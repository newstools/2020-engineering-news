Another eight new electric straddle carriers have arrived at the Durban Container Terminal (DCT) Pier 2 fully assembled, completing the terminal’s order of 23 for the current calendar year. This followed the delivery of 13 of the electric straddle carriers in August. The straddle carriers boast improved drive technology, starting reliability, maintainability, safety, usability and ergonomics, and enable a computer application to read data from the control system through Ethernet – providing comprehensive detail on statistics, real-time performance data and operational reports. Pier 2 terminal manager Zamo Ngcobo says the arrival of the straddle carriers, fully assembled, is a move that will result in improvements in operations within a short space of time. He adds that commissioning and endurance testing will still be conducted, with handover estimated in early October. DCT Pier 2 is responsible for handling most of South Africa’s container volumes, and the investment in container-handling equipment to replace ageing equipment is aimed at improving efficiency within the system. Complementing the equipment boost is the increased number of resources working the vessels, a new terminal structure, technological advancements for better decision-making and the implementation of a mandatory truck appointment system. DCT Pier 2 is one of 16 sea-cargo and three inland terminals managed by Transnet Port Terminals that have benefited from the R2-billion set aside to invest in replacement equipment this current calendar year. A further 22 straddle carriers are on order and expected to arrive between March and May 2021.
