Heightened security measures around the country’s fuel pipeline have assisted in the arrest of 16 suspects in the past week, Transnet Pipelines said in a statement on September 1. It noted that these arrests were linked to a number of attempted fuel theft incidents, which could have resulted in loss of fuel and extensive damage to the Transnet pipelines in three provinces. Suspects were arrested when attempting to steal fuel from a pipeline situated between Kendal and eMalahleni in Mpumalanga province, indicated Transnet. Other arrests took place in the Sasolburg area, in the Free State, and in the Bronkhorstspruit area on the Kendal to Waltloo pipeline, in Gauteng. Police also impounded fuel tankers, machinery and vehicles. “The swift action by all stakeholders involved enabled Transnet Pipelines teams to bring the entire line back into operation within 24 hours, averting possible impact on the security of supply,” said Transnet. It has collaborated with the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), National Crime Intelligence and the South African Police Services to deal with the issue of fuel theft in the country. “The arrests in the past few weeks indicate that the collaboration with various role-players is yielding positive results,” posited Transnet.
