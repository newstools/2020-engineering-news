KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube has congratulated CHEM ENERGY, a subsidiary of Taiwanese conglomerate CHEM Corporation, which has opened its $200-million fuel cell production factory in KwaZulu-Natal at the Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone. "This represents a milestone accomplishment for foreign investment, and we are excited to team up with CHEM and industry to help rapidly expand the adoption of this important technology and the growth of highly skilled jobs in this new industry sector,” said Dube-Ncube. CHEM Energy president Angelin Maharaj said fuel cells are no longer a thing for the future. “South Africa can ensure a reliable communications network and power to everyone, anywhere, anytime, without importing polluting diesel generators, diesel fuel and batteries today, using fuel cells and fuel made in South Africa, by South Africans, and playing a key role in rebuilding the economy,” said Maharaj. Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone CEO Hamish Erskine said having a fuel cell manufacturer within Dube TradePort will open the door for South Africa to ultimately establish local supply chains that service this type of high-tech manufacturing. CHEM Energy completed its state-of-the-art fuel cell factory on schedule at the end of March, pausing full operations in accordance with the national shutdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic, while continuing to support its installed systems throughout the Vodacom network.
