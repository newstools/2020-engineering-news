Industrial products provider BMG, part Engineering Solutions Group (ESG), has launched its new online shopping platform – BMG Online – to make doing business in the industrial sector easier. “Although the planning, development and execution for our e-commerce shopping portal go back over two years, the Covid-19 lockdown has had a material impact on BMG Online’s design and format. Benchmarked on international best practice, the new system is efficient, user-friendly and customer-centric. "BMG Online is an easy-to-navigate platform that enables 24-hour browsing and ordering from a selection of over 50 000 BMG products,” explains ESG group marketing executive Darryn Wright. The BMG Online platform offers new opportunities for doing business and digital shopping is merely one channel and will not detract from the technical support and personal care that the BMG teams are well known for, he notes. “This new online facility, which enhances the traditional way that we’ve done business for nearly 50 years, sees BMG leading the way in a highly competitive sector. This platform will add value to our service offering and make shopping for engineering components even more convenient," he adds. BMG Online offers many benefits, including easy product browsing, selection and ordering; the option for customers to click-and-collect from their nearest branch; swift delivery; and a fair returns policy. "The BMG team is on hand to assist customers in all sectors, including agriculture, mining, food and beverage plants, water and wastewater treatment facilities, oil, gas and petrochemical plants, as well as construction, engineering and general industry,” Wright says. Through BMG Online, customers have easy access to a comprehensive range of bearings, power transmission components and seals. Electric motors and electronic motion components are also now available online. BMG will soon be adding many more products to this electronic platform, including fasteners, tools and equipment.
