Russia’s State-owned nuclear energy group Rosatom signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the African Commission on Nuclear Energy (Afcone) this week. The MoU, signed simultaneously in Pretoria and Moscow, provides for cooperation between the two organisations in the peace uses of nuclear energy. The MoU establishes the basis for Rosatom and Afcone to cooperate in assisting African countries in implementing nuclear energy projects. It also covers the diversification of African States’ energy sources (including the use of renewable energy) and increasing their energy security. Rosatom and Afcone will cooperate in the distribution of impartial information regarding nuclear technologies, in increasing public awareness about the applications of nuclear technologies and in the promotion of education about the sector. They will also cooperate to build capacity in African countries. The MoU is regarded by the two parties as being a practical step in the implementation of agreements signed at the Russia-Africa Summit. This took place in late October last year.
