Following concerns about procurement and governance processes for the berth-deepening project at the Port of Durban, State-owned Transnet has suspended the main marine contract for the project while an investigation gets under way. Transnet says the concerns have the potential to impact the competitiveness of the process. As such, the company has referred the process to the Special Investigating UnitÂ as part of its existing investigation and has suspended any final decision-making, pending the outcome of the review processes. Transnet believes the capacity of the Port of Durban requires enhancement to retain its competitiveness, and therefore will review the procurement to ensure compliance. The company believes the decision taken is in the best interests of the company, customers and the public at large.
