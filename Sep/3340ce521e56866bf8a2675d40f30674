Following its cancellation this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Festival of Motoring will now return to the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit from August 26 to 29, 2021. Event organiser, Messe Frankfurt South Africa, says next year’s event will be the fifth edition of the yearly motoring celebration. The festival remains the largest industry-supported event in the country. The 2021 Festival of Motoring will focus on the celebration and achievements of the industry, while also highlighting innovations in the sector. The core of the event, however, remains the experiential platform for vehicle manufacturers to demonstrate their products and services. Content for the event includes five national motorsport events, an electrical vehicle village, a revamped 4 X 4 village and a gaming arcade. In addition, the 2021 event will implement a social investment programme ­– the Festival of Motoring Charity Drive, allowing involvement by all participants. “The Festival of Motoring needs to serve as the industry catapult, to build and maintain brand value for our participants,” says head of marketing Melissa Bender. Show director Judy Maharaj says she has applied a ‘reinvention strategy’ for participants, taking into consideration the realities the industry now faces. “Whilst the pandemic has been an unfortunate setback for the events industry as a whole, we are optimistic and excited to celebrate the evolution of the Festival of Motoring. “With 2021 being the fifth edition of the event, we are pleased to share that the South African-born brand is going global and a launch in the US is imminent. We will provide details of the international shows later this year.”
