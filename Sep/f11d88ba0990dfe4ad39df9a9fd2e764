The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) in KwaZulu-Natal has started the second phase of the Greytown Bulk Water Supply project to implement long-term measures dealing with water scarcity issues in different parts of the province. The implementation of the Greytown Bulk Water Supply project will provide emergency water relief and long-term water supply to Greytown and Enhlalakahle. Phase 1 of the project, which concluded in September 2010, included the refurbishing and upgrading of aging water infrastructure, the unclogging of drainage systems and the installation of new interconnecting pipes with valves chambers to restore water treatment works to an estimated peak capacity of 6 Mℓ/d, besides others. “We are now rolling out the implementation of Phase 2, which entails the extension of the Greytown Water Treatment Works by 7 Mℓ/d. The total capacity of the water treatment works will then be 13 Mℓ/d,” said DWS spokesperson Sputnik Ratau. Among the long-term measures of Phase 2 will be the development of abstraction works at Craigie Burn dam, raw water pump stations and bulk conveyance between Craigie Burn dam and additional Greytown water treatment works capacity of up to 16 Mℓ/day. “What this means is that there will be additional potable water storage to maintain specific hours of storage capacity and achieve spatial balance of bulk delivery with the growth of the town.” This will be through a 2.5 Mℓ reservoir at the Greytown Water Treatment Works, additional 2.5 Mℓ reservoir at the Enhlalakahle reservoir and the rehabilitation of the existing 2.5 Mℓ Enhlalakahle reservoir, he said. “We are working very closely with the UMzinyathi district municipality as the implementing agent to ensure accountability and prevent any possible acts of corruption,” Ratau added. The Greytown Bulk Water Supply Scheme is one of the Department’s Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant projects. The project implementation is ongoing and more updates would be provided in the future.
