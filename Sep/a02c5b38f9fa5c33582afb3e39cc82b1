The International Water Association (IWA) Fellows steering committee and the IWA board of directors have approved Rand Water GM for scientist services Professor Hamanth Kasan's nomination as an IWA Distinguished Fellow. Kasan is only the second South African and the first local expert of colour to receive this recognition. Kasan says he is gratified for being recognised after years of challenging engagements and contribution to the IWA. “I’m excited to have been nominated and honoured while still in the employ of Rand Water. In essence, I must say that I’m both proud and humbled to have the full support of the Rand Water leadership,” he comments. Kasan adds that his contribution at various levels of the IWA will include facilitating meaningful change to ensure that IWA represents global excellence and relevance. The Distinguished Fellowship recognises the impact individual professionals have made in their respective environment or sectors and the leadership and mentorship they provided. These include providing leadership to a multidisciplinary community to ensure the combination of various leading edge scientific projects, technical developments and creative mindsets from within IWA groups.
