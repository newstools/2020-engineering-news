Mobility solutions company Cartrack has launched a rapid response safety app, called Karu Safety. Karu Safety is a mobile phone app that allows subscribers to access private security services at the touch of a button. Once an emergency is activated, a 24/7 emergency control centre dispatches a response unit to the location. Karu Safety is connected to Cartrack’s existing national private security network, supported by its dedicated tactical response teams. Karu Safety is a natural evolution for Cartrack, says CEO Zak Calisto, when taking into account the company’s technology platform and its record of success in vehicle tracking and recovery. “We have unparalleled experience and insight into the needs of people living in South Africa for personal safety.” He says Cartrack has also seen the rate of vehicle theft and hijacking return to pre-lockdown levels, and in some cities, reaching record highs. The Karu Safety app is available for download from the Android and iOS app stores. This app is currently available to all Gauteng residents, with a rapid roll-out planned to the rest of the country. Cartrack customers will receive the service for free, for 12 months, and will thereafter pay a subsidised fee of R19.95 a month. The monthly fee for any member of the public that is not a Cartrack customer is R29.95 a month.
