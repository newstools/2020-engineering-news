Cabinet has approved the establishment of a Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission. This is in line with the Presidential Job Summit Framework Agreement signed during the Presidential Job Summit in 2018. The commission will coordinate the just transition of South Africa to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy and society by 2050. The structure of the commission will comprise members of government, social partners, civil society, as well as experts from academia and research institutions. South Africa is a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Cabinet also approved the submission of the country’s Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC Secretariat. This strategy will advance national climate change and development policy in a more coordinated, coherent and strategic manner. It provides mitigation measures focusing on key sectors of the economy: energy, industry, agriculture, forestry and land use, as well as waste.
