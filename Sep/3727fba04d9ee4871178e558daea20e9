State-owned Eskom has been granted permission from the South African National Roads AgencyÂ for the temporary road closure of the N3 north and southbound, just after the N3 De Hoek Toll Plaza, from 10:00 to 13:00 on September 17, to dismantle and remove a decommissioned high-voltage transmission overhead power line crossing the highway. All three phase conductors will be removed sequentially. A 15-minute period is required to remove each phase conductor across the road. During the removal of each phase, traffic will have to be stopped completely to ensure the safe removal of a phase conductor. Traffic will be allowed to flow after each phase conductor removal for about 30 minutes, while the removal equipment is set up for the next phase conductor.
