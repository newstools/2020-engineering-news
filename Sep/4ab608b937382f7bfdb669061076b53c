Agricultural original-equipment manufacturer John Deere Africa has announced that it will launch its newly developed three-dimensional (3D) and virtual reality (VR) showroom during the virtual Nampo Harvest Day 2020 event. The yearly agriculture-focused exhibition will be hosted from September 9 to 13. In not wanting to ruin the surprise for virtual attendees of the free-to-attend event, John Deere Africa says the company has 3D scanned more than 30 of its machinery models and built a virtual showroom to showcase them. “John Deere stand visitors have always enjoyed the size, scale and wow-factor that we contribute to Nampo and this year promises to be no exception,” John Deere Africa marketing manager Stephan Nel says. Additionally, the company has transformed its Revet John Deere Licensed Merchandise Store into a 3D shopping experience, which is probably one of the few, if not the first, for agriculture in Africa, the company notes. The company’s management team planned its virtual initiatives to assist farmers who are unable to travel to their local dealership during the pandemic and beyond. Nel explains that the virtual showroom and store allows farmers to walk around the equipment and browse as if they were in the actual shop, as well as participate in games, competitions and other interactive pages. He believes the showroom transformation contributes to the digital era and has a greater ability to portray movement. The virtual showroom depicts a realistic and visually appealing model that aids customers and supports the company’s dealers in the purchasing process. “Our showroom has exceeded our expectations and we are thrilled to showcase our world-class equipment utilizing top-of-the-range digital technology. "Visitors can interact with our stand at Nampo online, and view our monumental new showroom, without leaving the comfort of their own home,” adds John Deere Africa and Middle East MD Jacques Taylor.
