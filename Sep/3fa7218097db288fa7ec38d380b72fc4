From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Steel fabrication, steel erection and corrosion protection specialist Betterect and engineering, equipment and services solutions company FLSmidth have collaborated to deliver several 45m diameter modular bolted thickeners for an undisclosed mining project in southern Africa. Natasha Odendaal tells us more. Natasha Odendaal: The thickener project entailed the fabrication of several precisely engineered, carbon steel, very large diameter thickeners designed for exact alignment in accordance with the highest quality and design codes. Betterect MD Nicolette Skjoldhammer speaks to Engineering News about this project. Betterect MD Nicolette Skjoldhammer: Natasha Odendaal: In contrast with fabrication methods where tank sections are welded together during the site installation, a bolted thickener design allows for the thickeners’ modular sections to be bolted together on site, eliminating the need for hot work. Betterect MD Nicolette Skjoldhammer: Natasha Odendaal: The design also ensures a safer erection and assembly process, with significantly smaller, lesser skilled, installation crews completing the installation in a much shorter duration. Betterect MD Nicolette Skjoldhammer:  Sashnee Moodley:  That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
