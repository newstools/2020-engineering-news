South Africa’s water boards will be required to sign a declaration that binds and commits the leadership of water institutions to ensure there is no corrupt activity in the sector. Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, outlining some of her priorities over the next few months, called on the chairpersons of all the water boards across South Africa to commit themselves to clean governance. A top priority is to ensure that the water sector is not associated with any corruption. “We need an agreement with yourselves. We will sign a declaration with you that binds and commits us all as the leadership of water institutions to ensuring there is no corrupt activity in our area,” she said. “Let us commit ourselves to clean up the environment in the water sector. We can not have the same cloud hanging over us. “We will not tolerate any corrupt activity during our time. It is the only right thing to do,” Sisulu said.
