Following negotiations at the National Economic Development and Labour Council and the signing of the direction to that effect by Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi, the Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) has been extended until September 15. “With the lockdown for some industries extended to September 15, it only makes sense for us to continue to shield workers from the worst effects of the pandemic by extending the relief payments which have placed much-needed cash into the hands of ordinary workers in this country,” says Nxesi. These benefit payments are part of government-wide response to ease the burden of the pandemic and to ensure that, to the extent possible, workers are not prejudiced by the lockdown. Consequent to the extension, the Unemployment Insurance Fund will continue to receive applications for the March to end-July period until September 15. The receipt of Covid-19 TERS benefit applications for August to September 15 will close on October 30, and no further applications will be accepted beyond that date.
