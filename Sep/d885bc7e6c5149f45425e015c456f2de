Petrochemicals company Sasol has completed damage assessments of its Lake Charles Chemical Complex’s 14 manufacturing facilities, associated utilities and infrastructure following the landfall of Hurricane Laura on August 27. Hurricane Laura is considered to be one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit the US and significant property and utility infrastructure damage has been experienced across the Southwest Louisiana region. While there was moderate wind damage to cooling towers and some insulation and building damage, Sasol said in a statement on September 21 that there was no apparent damage to major process equipment, utilities or infrastructure. However, this will only be confirmed once electrical power is restored and all systems are tested. External electrical power service Entergy expects full load service and industrial-level reliability power to be available to Sasol and other industrial customers in the area by early-to-mid October. At the moment, removal of debris, repair work and start-up planning continue on site and regular employee shifts have resumed, with contractors working on-site to expedite readiness for startup. Sasol noted, however, that hundreds of the complex’s employees had suffered significant damage to their homes and remain in temporary housing while utility restoration and repair work is in progress. Sasol is assisting its employees with home preservation, essential supplies and financial aid. The company is also supporting the local authorities, utility partners and citizen groups in the community to assist in infrastructure recovery efforts. In addition, Sasol confirmed that its progress toward securing a partner in its US Base Chemicals business is “far advanced”, and that it was not impacted by Hurricane Laura.
