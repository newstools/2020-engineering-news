Following the passing of acclaimed human rights lawyer George Bizos on Wednesday evening, Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has called on South Africans to honour the anti-apartheid activist’s life by following his example of honesty, humility and dedication, and by repositioning the economy to be more inclusive and ethical. Busa pointed out Bizos’s opposition to corruption by leaders in society and said he was the exemplification of ethical, moral and humble leadership. “Business Unity SA notes with sadness and loss the passing of Advocate George Bizos. We are saddened by his passing but celebrate his amazing life. George Bizos played a pivotal role in the struggle for the democracy we enjoy.”
