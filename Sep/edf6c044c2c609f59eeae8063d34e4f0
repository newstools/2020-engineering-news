Poultry producer Astral Foods CEO Chris Schutte has been hospitalised following a motorcycle accident in celebration of his upcoming sixtieth birthday. Schutte was airlifted to a medical facility, in George, where he is being stabilised and treated for multiple fractures after the accident on September 19. Once stabilised, he will be transported to Johannesburg, after which he will have to undergo operations for the fractures sustained. At this stage, the recovery period is unknown. As in previous situations, Astral’s executive management team is in place to deal with all relevant operational matters and Astral CFO Daan Ferreira will be the central contact person during Schutte’s absence, the company assured shareholders in a September 21 release.
