Eutelsat Communications and Paratus have signed a multi-year distribution agreement to bring high quality network connectivity to South Africa. The agreement will result in Paratus accessing the operational flexibility and power of high throughput satellite Eutelsat Konnect to bring connectivity to remote and rural locations across South Africa. The service, launched at the beginning of September, offers packages of 10 Mb/s, 20 Mb/s and 30 Mb/s for businesses operating in the farming, game farms and the small and medium-sized enterprise segment, as well as consumers for working at home, home schooling and general Internet use. “Getting connectivity in remote locations is not easy; while price is key to attracting customers, the quality of network – both connection and support – quickly proves more important,” said Paratus South Africa MD Kallie Carlsen, noting that there is often a disconnect between customer expectations and the delivery of service. “With the partnership between Paratus and Eutelsat, we aim to overcome these boundaries and provide superior services for South Africa.” “This agreement reflects the significant demand on the African continent, and the unparalleled assets of the Eutelsat Konnect satellite in enabling it to be efficiently met. This contract also highlights the pertinence of Eutelsat’s multi-channel distribution strategy,” concluded Eutelsat Southern Africa sales director Guido Merien-van Sprundel.
