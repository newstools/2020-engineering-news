Mninawe Silinga has resigned as CEO of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC) to join Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) as CE. The CDC notes that this has been long coming, after numerous attempts by other State-owned entities (SoEs) to enlist Silinga's services in recent years. The CDC notes that the 22-year relationship between it and Transnet has been positive and that, with Silinga at TNPA, this relationship will grow further. The CDC congratulated Silinga on his achievements as the CDC CEO, including establishing a leadership team that developed and operated the then Coega Industrial Development Zone (IDZ).
