German testing, inspection and certification group Dekra and Automotive Investment Holdings (AIH) have partnered to provide a range of business sectors with a Covid-19 safety seal. The Covid-19 Dekra Standard Trusted Facility Seal is available to the automotive; retail; supply and manufacturing; and tourism and hospitality sectors, says Dekra South Africa COO Stefan Bleitner. The seal indicates to a business’ staff and customers that the management and its facilities adhere to highest hygiene standards in terms of combatting the spread of Covid-19, he notes. Bleitner says the seal is aimed at giving people peace of mind – independent peace of mind – as they step out of lockdown. Assessments for the seal involves an inspection of each facility, with the seal provided based on how well the business adheres to three measurements: World Health Organisation Covid-19 regulations, local Covid-19-related regulations in South Africa, and best practice, he notes. It is about compliance to regulations, readiness to do business and trust. Each industry is measured to a different standard matrix, says Bleitner. The physical inspection can last one to two days, depending on the size of the facility, the type of industry and the number of employees, he adds. The seal is valid for six months. AIH is responsible for project management as the programme rolls out, says AIH’s Paulo Fernandes. “A seal like this could give comfort to staff and customers and ensure that facilities remain open as we move through the Covid-19 pandemic. “The aim is to ensure that people get back to work so that we can get the economy going again.” Bleitner says while no South African facility has yet received the Covid-19 Dekra Standard Trusted Facility Seal, all BMW dealers in Poland have, for example. “We expect Covid-19 to follow us through to 2022. Even if we get a vaccination at the end of the year, it will take time to vaccinate billions of people.”
