The Volkswagen Polo is the country’s most-searched-for hatchback under R250 000, with Volkswagen also dominating this important segment of the motor industry, says AutoTrader. AutoTrader is the country’s largest digital automotive marketplace. While the Polo was the most-searched-for hatchback in the sub-R250 000 price bracket in August, the list of top ten models contained no fewer than three Volkswagen derivatives (see list below). AutoTrader CEO George Mienie says the sub-R250 000 sector has been one of the most popular price range segments within the hatchback market during lockdown level 2. “This price bracket constituted a massive 72.3% of price-related searches for hatchbacks during August.” According to the 2020 AutoTrader Car Industry Report, hatchbacks are the body-type with the lowest selling price and mileage combination, and they are also the most sold body-type in the country. In the last year, they accounted for 31% of the total number of used cars sold in South Africa. The domination of the Polo in this segment comes as no surprise, says Mienie. “According to the 2020 AutoTrader Car Industry Report, the Polo was the second most sold used car in South Africa in the last year, contributing 4.7% of all cars sold, at an average selling price of R205 238, an average mileage of 58 652 km and an average year model of 2016.” Similarly, the Golf – in second place for most searched hatches in August in the sub-R250 000 sector – is not a surprise listing. “One of the models in the Golf range, the iconic GTI, also performed well last year, achieving first place in the AutoTrader Car Industry Report when it comes to variant searches. “It was responsible for a substantial 1.5-million searches,” says Mienie.
