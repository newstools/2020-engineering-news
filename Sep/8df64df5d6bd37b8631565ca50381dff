From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Seven hydrogen fuel cells, supplied by local hydrogen economy company Bambili Energy, are now powering a field hospital, set up as part of government’s anti-Covid-19 policy, and located at 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria. Bambili is focussed on manufacturing fuel cell systems and facilitating the commercialisation of intellectual property developed under the Hydrogen South Africa programme. The programme is a project of the Department of Science and Technology. Department Director-General Dr Phil Mjwara attended the official handover of the fuel cells and we asked him about the significance of the event for the department.  Sashnee Moodley: Bambili Energy electrical engineer Mpho Malaza explains how the hydrogen fuel cells work.  Sashnee Moodley:  That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report.
