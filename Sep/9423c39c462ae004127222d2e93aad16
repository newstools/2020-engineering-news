Audi South Africa CEO Trevor Hill has departed the company after his contract came to an end on August 31. Hill, who was born in South Africa, left the country in 1997, returning in 2017 to head up the Audi brand within the local Volkswagen group. During his international assignments, Hill worked in Germany, Japan, China, South Korea and the Middle East. Hill has returned to Audi’s global headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany, where he takes up a new position within the Audi Sport division from this month. “Trevor has always been an excellent team player and an ardent ambassador to the Audi brand,” says Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) sales and marketing director Mike Glendinning. “On behalf of the board of management of VWSA, we would like to thank him for his contribution to the Audi brand in the local market and wish him well in his new assignment.” No successor has been announced yet.
