Airline Emirates will soon resume flights to the King Shaka International Airport, in KwaZulu-Natal,  MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube said on September 28. Flights were previously suspended as a result of the Covid-19-related lockdown in South Africa. “As we reconstruct and transform our economy, the aviation sector remains critical. We acknowledge the fact that before lockdown, King Shaka International Airport had served between five- and ten-million passengers. This includes domestic and international travellers into the province,” she commented. She said Emirates had been a reliable partner since the year 2009. “The airline has carried over two-million passengers on the route and we have been working well in partnership with them. We will continue to work with the airline to position this province as a destination for tourists and for those who want to do business. We are looking forward to another ten years of increases in the number of visitors to KwaZulu-Natal,” said Dube-Ncube.
