Airbus has received a firm order for an Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) from European organisation, Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), for the management of cooperative armament programmes.
 
The order, which OCCAR has placed on behalf of North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (Nato's) Support & Procurement Agency, follows the decision by Luxembourg to maximise its participation in the Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF) programme, with a significant increase from 200 to 1 200 flight hours contracted. The aircraft is part of the three additional options originally included in the contract and will increase the MMF fleet to nine aircraft.
 
This new order comes after the successful delivery of the first two aircraft, with training and operational activities already in place. The additional aircraft will provide greater availability of the MMF fleet, enabling other Nato nations to cover their needs in air-to-air refueling, strategic transport and medical evacuation, a statement issued on September 28 says.
 
The MMF programme is funded by the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Germany, Belgium and Czech Republic who have the exclusive right to operate the Nato–owned aircraft in a pooling arrangement, a prime example of European operational defence collaboration. The aircraft will be configured for in-flight refueling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation operations.
