The Western Cape province has launched a R27-million Covid-19 Business Relief Fund in support of small businesses affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Western Cape spokesperson for the Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities Francine Higham said in a statement released on Tuesday that the Fund is directed at small businesses in the formal and informal sectors. “We know that times have been tough for businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic and that is why, from the start, we have been working hard to support businesses, especially small businesses, to open safely and responsibly, so we can save jobs and save the economy in the Western Cape,” she said. The Fund will provide assistance to businesses in the form of a financial grant and will be used exclusively to subsidise business expenses such as fixed costs, operational costs, supplier debt and other pressure cost items. The department has also launched a Covid-19 workplace safety campaign to remind businesses of the importance of implementing health and safety guidelines in the workplace, while encouraging them to make use of the tools and resources available on the ministry’s website. “With the move to Alert Level 1, which allows more businesses to safely open, this Fund is an important step in our economic recovery plan to help businesses to rebuild and save jobs in the Western Cape. And so, I would like to encourage all interested small businesses to apply. We look forward to receiving your submissions,” Higham said. For more information on the Fund or to apply, click here.
