Work on  the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM) is officially under way, with the first industry working group meeting having taken place on August 26. SAREM is one of 14 industry specific masterplans being developed under the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC’s) national masterplan process, which was launched in July 2019. It represents an opportunity to identify jobs and investment in the renewable-energy sector linked to the Integrated Resource Plan 2019 (IRP 2019), as well as to articulate how job creation and investment could be maximised through supportive policy and the removal of impediments to investment. SAREM does not replace the IRP 2019, but rather seeks to identify the industrialisation and employment opportunities that will arise from the implementation of the IRP 2019. As with the other masterplans under development, SAREM builds on the successful approach taken by the automotive sector, as well as the sector plan development process adopted jointly by the private and public sectors, led by the Public Private Growth Initiative in conjunction with the Presidency. Key stakeholders in the process include government departments, including the DTIC and the Department of Minerals Resources and Energy, as well as State entities, civil society organisations, labour, industry experts and academics. The outcome of the first industry working group included input into the SAREM vision. Key themes that emerged included the importance of securing inclusive economic growth through investment into sustainable energy infrastructure, for all South Africans. Renewable-energy sector stakeholders who want to be kept informed of the SAREM development process and industry working group meetings have been invited to sign up to a database that is administered by GreenCape, a nonprofit organisation that is supporting the widespread adoption of economically viable green economy solutions from South Africa.
