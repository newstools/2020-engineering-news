In a joint statement, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) have demanded urgent investigations into two high-ranking individuals at South African Airways Technical (SAAT). SAAT is the specialist maintenance, repair and overhaul subsidiary of the SAA group. The two individuals are SAAT board member Thandeka Mgoduso and current SAAT CEO Adam Voss. The reason is that they approved a financial settlement for a former head of procurement at SAAT, Advocate Nontsasa Memela, who had been dismissed from her post following an internal disciplinary hearing. But this finding against Memela was subsequently reversed by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). According to Numsa and Sacca, SAAT received legal advice to take the CCMA decision on review, but the company decided not to do so. Instead, the financial settlement was approved. The two unions described the CCMA ruling as “shocking”. Further, they charged that “SAAT has no difficulty with using litigation as a tool to frustrate Numsa and Sacca members, but when it comes to fighting corruption it suddenly becomes incredibly shy”. “The delay, in taking action against those implicated in corruption, is unacceptable,” they asserted. “Numsa and Sacca therefore intend opening criminal cases against all individuals implicated in corruption at the airline as a matter of urgency. Workers should not have to pay for the sins of the corrupt through job losses. Their actions have led to the airline collapsing and it being placed under business rescue.”
