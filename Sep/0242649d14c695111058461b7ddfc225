Technology solutions provider TechSoft International has developed an integrated and data-rich solution to assist in improving revenue management and collection for struggling municipalities. With the company’s C3 platform, municipal entities are said to be able to leverage a software tool that will enable them to improve efficiencies by providing accurate billing, correcting imbalances, identifying potential nontechnical losses and empowering them to effectively collect outstanding revenue. Using advanced analytics, this software solution is designed to enable municipalities to identify existing loss reduction interventions, incorrect customer accounts, attributes and contracts, electricity theft, faulty metering, inaccurate/ineffective billing and collections, and a host of other issues, said TechSoft. “Public sector organisations are under huge pressure to improve revenue collection, but it is easier said than done. Often data is disparate, systems aren’t interoperable and they just don’t have the visibility needed to identify where they are bleeding cash. "What they then find themselves in is an endless cycle of outstanding money that negatively impacts their ability to deliver the citizen services they are mandated to. Often this is simply because their own systems have failed them,” said TechSoft International MD Clinton Scott. “Our economy is under immense strain and our gross domestic product has contracted, but for business to thrive and to continue with the entrepreneurial spirit so inherent in Africa, and for our public sector to be in a position to deliver the services, we need to sustain growth. "This extends not just to electricity, but working roads, refuse collection, water supply and citizen services. This can only be done through effective revenue management and collection of the finances owed to these entities – which is why we want to help our public sector partners and customers meet their goals,” he added.
