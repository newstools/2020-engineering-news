As a result of the measures implemented in South Africa to curb the spread of Covid-19, the Competition Commission has extended the closing date for public comments into the Market Inquiry into the Land-based Public Passenger Transport to June 30. Submissions had been due to close on March 31. Meanwhile, the deadline for comments on the draft Guidelines for Competition in the South African Automotive Aftermarket Industry, published in February, has also been postponed to June 30. The commission has invited automotive industry stakeholders (especially small and independent repairers and maintenance service providers), regulators, consumers and any other interested party to submit their views and comments on the draft guidelines.
