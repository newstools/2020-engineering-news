Global corporate governance body, the Chartered Secretaries Southern Africa (CCSA), has rebranded to the Chartered Governance Institute of Southern Africa (CGISA). The organisation offers corporate governance curriculum for those embarking on a career as either a chartered secretary or a chartered governance professional. “We have retained the word chartered in our name which continues to be the mark of quality and high standards that have defined us for over 110 years,” the organisation says.
