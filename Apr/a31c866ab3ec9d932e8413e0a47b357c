Europe-based global major aerospace group Airbus reported on April 1 that most of its facilities in Spain were cooperating in the production of visor frames, for use in personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel fighting the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. The frames are being produced using additive manufacturing machines, popularly called 3D printers. With more than 20 such 3D printers working around the clock, the Airbus facilities have already made hundreds of visors. The visors are produced to a patented design, using Polylactic Acid plastic (which is a bioplastic – that is, it comes from biomass). “One of the reasons I love my job is the capability we have for advanced design and quick manufacture,” enthused Airbus Protospace head Alvaro Jara. “Overnight, we have gone from making aerospace concepts to medical equipment. This genuinely makes a difference in the fight against the pandemic and I couldn’t be prouder of our teams working day and night on this Airbus project.” Most production at Airbus sites in Spain was paused on March 29 as part of the Spanish government’s attempts to contain Covid-19. However, workers were allowed to continue working at the company’s facilities so that they could continue to produce this essential equipment. This Spanish PPE project was also being supported by Airbus facilities in Germany. These were Airbus Protospace Germany, the Airbus Composite Technology Centre and the ‘Mobility goes Additive’ 3D printing network. Covid-19 has hit Spain hard. As of April 1, the country had recorded 102 136 cases of the disease. There have been 9 053 fatalities. The Spanish government ordered a national lockdown on March 14. The lockdown restrictions were tightened on March 30.
