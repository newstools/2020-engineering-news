Emerging natural gas and helium producer Renergen has completed the design of the pipeline at its Virginia gas project, in the Free State, thereby achieving the project’s third milestone. According to the company’s milestone tracker, the intended date of completion was April 1, with a tolerance level of seven days either way. While this means that the milestone was achieved eight days behind schedule, on April 16, the company still believes this a considerable achievement when taking the current lockdown conditions into account. This milestone is not considered to be on the critical path for the final completion date and therefore Renergen says it does not anticipate that missing the intended milestone date will lead to any further delays in the final project completion. The pipeline is intended to be completed before the liquefiers are delivered in South Africa. CEO Stefano Marani says that, based on current circumstances, Renergen has no reason to believe it is likely to suffer any material delays to the scheduled turn on date. As such, Marani and the company remains “cautiously optimistic”. “Obviously the world finds itself in uncertain and extreme conditions and anything can change quite suddenly, but we remain confident that our position as a disrupter to traditional fuels, and as a new entrant to the helium supply market, stands us in good stead and hope to emerge having gained ground,” he comments.
