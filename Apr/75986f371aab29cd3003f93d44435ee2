The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) on Thursday assured that the  Zithabiseni Resort and Conference Centre (ZRCC) is a feasible quarantine site for Covid-19 patients. MTPA spokesperson Kholofelo Nkambule revealed that there were 115 people quarantined at the site: 20 of those are foreign nationals and 95 are South Africans. “The Zithabiseni Resort and Conference Centre is a suitable facility that has been identified and accordingly approved by the Department of Health as one of the quarantine sites in the province. We acknowledge that there are dilapidated buildings within the Resort, but we can confirm that the ones selected for quarantine are in satisfactory and habitable condition,” said Nkambule. Nkambule said that most of those repatriated from Mozambique are frustrated and do not want to be quarantined. “Some of the foreign nationals under quarantine cannot handle to stay at the resort for 14 days. As such, they are focused on ensuring that their quarantine period is reduced to three days instead. We have noted their concerns that the accommodation provided at ZRCC does not meet their preferred and expected standards; hence their claim that they have already been under self-quarantine previously, and as such, there is no need to be quarantined again,” said Nkambule. Nkambule said each chalet at the resort has been provided with one 500 ml bottle of sanitiser. “The team was informed about the daily health monitoring that is conducted by the Department of Health. A record of all chronic patients has been taken, in order to ensure that they receive the necessary support and assistance,” she said.
