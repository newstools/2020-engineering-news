Telecommunications giant MTN has been awarded the most valuable telecom brand in Africa by brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance. A report by Brand Finance highlighted that MTN’s solid overall performance for the year had boosted its brand value, despite facing challenging economic conditions and regulatory challenges in some markets. “Amid these unprecedented times in fighting a global pandemic, MTN Group is humbled by the Brand Finance recognition and our progress in rising up through the ranks of this year’s Telecoms 150 report,” MTN group president and CEO Rob Shuter said in a statement. Brand finance also recognised MTN for its focus on customers and providing a high-quality service across all its markets, as well as acknowledged its Bright strategy to grow revenues through data and digital, while also focusing on growing its subscriber base. “MTN is to be commended for its performance in its home market as well as further afield. They are increasingly recognised throughout Africa by their customers as providing high quality service, because their brand image is deeply rooted on more than just marketing campaigns,” added Brand Finance CEO David Haigh. Further, Brand Finance upgraded MTN’s brand strength rating from AAA- to AAA, in recognition of an increasingly strong leadership position in telecommunication services throughout Africa and the other markets within which it operates, as well as increasingly resilient network investments.
