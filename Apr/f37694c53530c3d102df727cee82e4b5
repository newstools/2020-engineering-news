The Innovative Pharmaceutical Association South Africa (Ipsasa) has confirmed its commitment to continue supplying medicines to people living with chronic diseases during the Covid-19 lockdown period. The association represents 26 research-based pharmaceutical companies. Ipasa says the outbreak of the virus has shown that the most at-risk population are people older than 65, with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, diabetes, and liver and kidney diseases. The association and its members say that, while health professionals and researchers worldwide work tirelessly to develop a vaccine for Covid-19, they are committed to ensuring that those with underlying conditions receive sufficient supply of much-needed medications. Ipasa and its members remain sensitive to factors including safeguarding access to critical medicines, ensuring equitable access to critical medicines, contributing assets and expertise to help lessen the Covid-19 impact and contributing to the collection of data to support decision-making. The healthcare sector is collaborating with various stakeholders to find solutions and flatten the curve of new infections. Further, it has become more apparent that it is everyone’s responsibility to practice the highest standards of hygiene and practice physical distancing while the industry, academia, regulators, governments and the World Health Organization  harness the power of science to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19. Ipasa is joining hands with medical professionals and industry stakeholders to assist in any way possible. Medical doctors from member companies are volunteering their time at various hospitals and providing medical advice on the recently launched national medical support hotline.
