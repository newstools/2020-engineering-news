The South African Housing and Infrastructure Fund (SAHIF) has pledged to provide 50 temporary housing structures that will provide shelter for 200 South Africans in need, following government’s appeal to business leaders to assist in creating solutions to assist during the Covid-19 pandemic. This commitment is to assist the government to provide temporary residential units to promote physical distancing for individuals currently residing in overcrowded communities. “We have a housing crisis in South Africa. People live in overcrowded spaces and if the coronavirus reaches those places it will be hard to control. As a company within the property sector, we made this pledge to slow down the spread of the virus. We believe that it is up to each one of us to do what we can to flatten the curve and reduce the possible impact of this virus,” says SAHIF CEO Rali Mampeule. “Part of the work we do is focused on the empowerment of those less fortunate – with this pledge we are supporting the government the only way we know how, through providing serviced land and quality housing, which will promote physical distancing for South Africans living in overcrowded communities,” adds SAHIF CFO Kameel Keshav. SAHIF's core business objective is to accelerate the delivery of serviced land which will ultimately create housing in close proximity to work, school, public transport and public health, improving the quality of life for many South Africans. “SAHIF remains committed to its responsibility as a good corporate citizen and through this donation we hope to support those whose lives have been disrupted by the pandemic,” the organisation said.
