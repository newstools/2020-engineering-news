The first Embraer A-29 Super Tucano light attack and reconnaissance aircraft for the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) made its maiden flight in the US, at Jacksonville, Florida, on April 17. (In addition to its primary Super Tucano production line in Brazil, Embraer has a second production line, established in conjunction with US company Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), in Jacksonville.) The NAF has 12 Super Tucanos on order. “This is an exciting milestone in the production of these A-29s for the Nigerian Air Force,” affirmed Embraer Defence and Security president and CEO Jackson Schneider. “The Jacksonville production line is active, and Embraer and SNC look forward to seeing these aircraft continue to roll off the line in the coming months.” “The aircraft met or exceeded all the requirements and we are very pleased with the successful flight,” reported SNC IAS business area VP: tactical aircraft systems and programmes Ed Topps. “SNC and our partner, Embraer, are certain the Nigerian Air Force will be pleased with these aircraft.” The two companies were awarded the contract for the aircraft in December 2018. Nigeria’s first aircraft, and all the subsequent ones, would be transferred to a facility in Centennial, Colorado, for mission modification and final testing. The programme was on schedule for the delivery of the aircraft during next year. Nigerian pilots would be trained on the aircraft before they were formally delivered to the NAF. The Nigerian contract included mission planning systems, mission debriefing systems, ground support equipment, spares, ground training devices, and US contractor support. The Super Tucano has already been chosen by 15 air forces around the world. The aircraft was combat-proven and could also be used for basic and advanced flying and combat training.
