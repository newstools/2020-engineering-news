Fluid power and automation company Bosch Rexroth South Africa has responded to Netcare's call for assistance from the local three-dimensional (3D) printing community to produce face masks for first-line responders. Bosch Rexroth subsidiary Tectra Automation Mechatronics technician Nico Davies immediately started production of fully re-usable face masks. Fellow group company HYSA Supply Chain manager André Steyn is also participating in the project. From his home, using his own 3D printer and materials, he is making the clips that hold the mask and shield in place. Tectra Automation has pledged to cover all material costs in support of this initiative. Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages will continue to be an issue as manufacturer and supply chains cannot meet the growing demand globally. As is often the case, PPE items require disposal after use, Bosch Rexroth says. As such, Davies has designed a mask that will last one person indefinitely, with the mask’s special filter to be replaced when needed.
