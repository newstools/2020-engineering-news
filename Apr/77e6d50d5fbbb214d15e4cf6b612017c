The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has delivered another 180 water tanks across Gauteng. This brings the total number of water tanks deployed to 1 662 throughout the province as part of an intervention to fight the rapidly spreading Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to supplying water tanks and tankers (trucks) to destitute communities, the DWS is also working on resolving water challenges it is alerted to through communication with its call centre. “To avoid the possibility of communities being hard hit by the outbreak of the virus, the department has delivered 129 more water tanks in the City of Tshwane, increasing the number of water tanks provided to 319. In the City of Ekurhuleni an additional 51 water tanks were deployed to supplement the 166 already received,” the DWS said in a statement on April 7. “The DWS is making steady progress in supplying water to communities, adding that the delivery of water tanks to the communities would make a huge difference in deterring the spread of the virus,” said DWS Gauteng head Sibusiso Mthembu. “The present situation calls on us as government and like-minded structures to fight tooth and nail to see to it that disadvantaged communities are not left to their own devices. All of us must be instruments of change so that we provide protection to people who need us most at this time,” he concluded.
