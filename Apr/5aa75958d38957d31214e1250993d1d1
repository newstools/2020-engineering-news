Wholesale and retail group Massmart's management board and executive committee have resolved to personally fund, through a waiver of a portion of their salaries, 230 t of food for distribution to vulnerable communities. The contribution will be made to FoodForward South Africa (SA) through the delivery of 77 t of food a month, for three months, starting in April. International holding company, Walmart International will also match the donation with an additional 230 t of food being donated to FoodForward SA during the same period. The total contribution will amount to about 1.85-million meals. Massmart CE Mitch Slape says that, from discussions with FoodForward SA, it was ascertained that a significant increase in food insecurity arose from the Covid-19 disruption to economic activity, particularly among unemployed people in the informal sector. FoodForward SA MD Andy du Plessis says nutrition plays an important role in maintaining a strong immune system. “Without access to proper nutrition, the vulnerable in our society are at even greater risk, particularly with the imminent onset of winter.” He adds that the next few months are going to be “extremely difficult” for food insecure communities. “We hope that others will follow the lead of the Massmart executive committee and their nonexecutive directors.” In addition to supporting FoodForward SA with a previous 50 t food donation, Massmart has supplied or funded protective face visors for healthcare workers, as well as hazardous materials suits and assorted merchandise for Covid-19 drive-through and testing facilities operated by Gift of the Givers. FoodForward SA has tried and tested systems in place to ensure immediate distribution of food to those most in need, including the aged, orphaned, disabled and homeless.
