The additional R20-billion allocation promised by President Cyril Ramaphosa to fund emergency water and sanitation provision during the state of national disaster has been welcomed by the Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation and the Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Water and Sanitation and Human Settlements. “The announcement is a confirmation of the extent to which the government is willing to go to empower our people to fight this dreaded Covid-19 disease,” said Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Water and Sanitation and Human Settlements chairperson China Dodovu. The R20-billion bolsters the R306.5-million budget already reallocated by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS), added Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation chairperson Machwene Semenya. However, the committees cautioned against “corrupt elements” that might see this as an opportunity to fill their pockets with these relief funds. “The National Treasury and DWS, as well as the National and Provincial Departments of Cooperative Governance, must put in checks and balances necessary to ensure that municipalities deliver on the envisioned programmes,” Dodovu said. The intended next joint meeting will consider how the DWS and municipalities plan to roll out water provision programmes assisted by this funding.
