Water and liquid management solutions provider Xylem South Africa has appointed Jehiel E Lawrence as its new sales director for Southern Africa. Lawrence will be responsible for driving sales within the region and identifying new opportunities in areas where Xylem’s current presence has not yet had a significant impact from a market share perspective. He will also be responsible for the identification of partners and grow Xylem’s value proposition and vision of maintaining a scarce and valuable resource, namely water, to society at large. “The challenges around water require the brightest minds and strong experience to develop solutions and new ideas. It is about harnessing existing partnerships and building new ones, driving unique solutions for Africa,” said Xylem South Africa MD Vincent Chirouze. “Xylem Water Solutions and its corporate vision of ‘Lets Solve Water’ is what really attracted me to the position. This role not only provides me with the ability to contribute positively to the business, but also to contribute to the wellness of the planet at large,” added Lawrence, who has over 18 years of expertise in the chemical distribution sector. Lawrence, who has successfully held numerous directorships and senior management positions in his career and built and led numerous teams across different geographies and cultures, qualified with BSc and BCom (Hons) degrees from the University of the Western Cape and completed an Executive Development Programme from Stellenbosch University.
