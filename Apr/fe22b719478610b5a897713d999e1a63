Social media platform Facebook has expanded its Covid-19 Information Centre to include another 17 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. The firm’s information centres aim to provide the latest news and trusted information on Covid-19 at the top of the social media network’s news feed as the virus continues to spread globally. “We have built the information centres, in collaboration with national health partners, to ensure that people can get access to information from trusted health sources,” said Facebook Africa head of public policy Kojo Boakye. The centre, already available in South Africa, obtains information from health authorities and offers resources and tips to stay healthy and support families and communities during the pandemic. “It includes real-time updates from national health authorities and global organisations such as the World Health Organisation, as well as helpful articles, videos and posts about social distancing and preventing the spread of Covid-19,” Boakye commented. Facebook users can opt in to follow the centre to get notifications and see updates in their news feed. The centre will now be available in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, the Seychelles, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo. “The launch of the Covid-19 Information Centre on Facebook in more than 17 countries across sub-Saharan Africa aligns with our commitment to making accurate, timely information about the pandemic accessible to all communities.”
