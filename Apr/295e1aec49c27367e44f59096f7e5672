Telecommunications group Vodacom’s new 30-day data price packages, with price cuts of up to 40% and free data lifelines, went live on April 1. The group, as part of an agreement with the Competition Commission, will reduce the price of its 50 MB, 30-day data bundle by 40% to R12, effective immediately. Vodacom also slashed the prices of its 30-day 150 MB, 325 MB and 500 MB data bundles by between 21% and 33% to R29, R55 and R79 respectively. The 1 GB, 3 GB and 5 GB 30-day packages now cost R99, R229 and R349 respectively, representing decreases of 34%, 23% and 14% respectively. The 10 GB data package contracted 22% to R469 and the 20 GB bundle dropped 31% to R699. The latest data reductions will complement the discounted bundle offers that will also be made available to prepaid customers in more than 2 000 less affluent suburbs and villages around the country, said Vodacom Consumer Business unit chief officer Jorge Mendes. “For qualifying communities to access further discounted voice and data deals, they need to simply click on the scrolling ConnectU banner on the platform,” he explained. “Vodacom can play a critical role in supporting society during this challenging time and we’re committed to doing whatever we can to help customers stay connected,” Mendes continued. Through its zero-rated platform ConnectU, free data will be provided to access various essential services, as well as free access to educational content for learners and students enrolled in schools and universities and content aimed at social development. The value of these initiatives is some R2.7-billion over the next year.
