The JSE has contributed R34.4-million to South Africa’s Solidarity Fund, to combat the spread of Covid-19 and in aid of impact mitigation measures. The stock exchange pledged it would donate two days’ worth of trading revenue to the fund, which forms part of its #Trade4Solidarity campaign, while the CEO and directors pledged to donate 30% of their salaries over the next three months to the fund. “When President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the fund, we knew we had to rise up and play our part. We put out a call to our market participants and I am humbled at how everyone has rallied together jointly as the capital markets ecosystem in our efforts to donate to the Solidarity Fund. The money raised will no doubt touch many lives that have been impacted by the coronavirus,” says JSE CEO Leila Fourie.
