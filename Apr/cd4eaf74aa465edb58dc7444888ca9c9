JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Gold mining company AngloGold Ashanti has embarked on a remarkable number of humanitarian initiatives to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, including making two of its mining hospitals available to the provincial governments of North West and Gauteng for the exclusive use by them to treat and isolate Covid-19 patients. The Johannesburg- and New York-listed company, headed by Canadian Kelvin Dushnisky, said on Thursday that it was working on a number of fronts to support healthcare providers, bolster community health and hygiene responses, and to provide relief to the most vulnerable in society.

But the building still has the necessary oxygen piping infrastructure and other design elements needed for a fully functioning healthcare centre and the Gauteng Health Department is working to ensure that it is fully equipped and recommissioned in the coming weeks. “The provincial health teams have worked with incredible diligence to ensure these facilities are made available to serve the public. We’re pleased to work alongside the authorities in this national effort,” AngloGold Ashanti VP health Dr Bafedile Chauke stated in a media release to Mining Weekly on Thursday. Other AngloGold Ashanti support initiatives include: AngloGold Ashanti VP sustainability Kgomotso Tshaka said the company was committed to multi-stakeholder efforts aimed at curtailing the spread of Covid-19 and the protection of those most at risk from the devastating effects of the virus.

At the end of 2019, the company had $463-million of cash, and $2-billion of debt and revolving credit facilities (RCF) with $1.42-billion and R4.65-billion available.
