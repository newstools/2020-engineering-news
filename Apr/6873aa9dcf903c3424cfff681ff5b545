The University of Cape Town (UCT) has set up a Coronavirus Disease 2019 emergency fund to assist in the fight against the virus and its impact on the UCT community. The university has urged members of the UCT community to rally behind the fight against the pandemic by making contributions to the fund. UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng will donate 20% of her salary to the fund for three months, while she already donates 10% of her salary monthly to the Mamokgethi Phakeng Scholarship Fund.  She set the fund up in July 2018 when she took office at UCT. In addition to the Covid-19 emergency fund that has been set up through the Development and Alumni Department, the UCT Council has approved a separate R30-million fund to assist the university with responding to the pandemic. Some of the funds already raised, including a R5-million donation by the Motsepe Foundation announced late last month by UCT Chancellor Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe, have provided an invaluable source of crucial support for UCT in implementing a range of measures to support students during this unprecedented period. These include the purchase of laptops for students in need to ensure they are able to continue with online learning, at a total of R16.4-million. Further funds have been used to assist with travel arrangements for students after the lockdown was effected by the government, including travel to other African countries. When the lockdown is lifted and students and staff start making their way back to campus, the funds will support a critical need to ensure the safety of everyone through, besides others, the purchase of all the necessary personal protective equipment. “The setting up of a dedicated Covid-19 fund further underscores the critical need for all – within the university community and the broader society – to work together in this unprecedented crisis and contribute in any way,” UCT says.
