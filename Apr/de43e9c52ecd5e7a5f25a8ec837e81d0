South Africa’s average dam levels have increased from 67.6% to 68.8% week-on-week despite poor rainfalls. The latest weekly report on dam levels by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) shows that Gauteng has the highest average at 101%, followed by the Northern Cape at 94% and Free State at 80.1%. The North West has also improved its levels drastically from below 50% in December last year, to 71.2% this week, while Limpopo’s average dam levels have been maintained at 68.3%. In Mpumalanga, the average dam levels increased marginally from 75.1% to 75.7% week-on-week, while KwaZulu-Natal edged up from 61.5% to 62%. “The dam levels in Eastern Cape have not changed since the last week’s 56.1%, while Western Cape dropped slightly to 39%. However, winter rains are expected to increase the Western Cape’s dam levels when they start coming down at the end of next month,” the DWS said in a statement.
