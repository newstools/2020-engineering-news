The JSE has announced that its board of directors and group CEO have pledged to donate at least 30% of their salaries to the national Solidarity Fund for the next three months. This follows after the JSE donated its trading revenue for April 15 and 16 to the Solidarity Fund. The fund is a special purpose vehicle set up to help government and civil society fund South Africa’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, to prevent its further transmission and support those affected by it. “The response by our capital markets participants to work together to support us in this venture at this critical time in our history is yet another example of the spirit of nationhood and generosity that exists in this country. This pandemic has further highlighted the stark inequalities and deep levels of poverty in our society,” says JSE chairperson Nonkululeko Nyembezi. The JSE has urged other listed companies to also support the Solidarity Fund.
