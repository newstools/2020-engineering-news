President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams on special leave for two months, one of which will be unpaid, for violating the regulations of the national lockdown amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. A recent social media post showed her attending a lunch with former Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training and Member of Parliament Mdudui Manana. South Africans accused the Minister of setting a bad example as the country is under national lockdown. She has been asked to deliver a public apology to the nation. The President expressed his disapproval of the Minister’s actions, which he says undermines the requirement that all citizens stay at home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

The President accepted the Minister’s apology for the violation but said he was unmoved by the mitigating factors she presented.

“The nationwide lockdown calls for absolute compliance on the part of all South Africans. Members of the National Executive carry a special responsibility in setting an example to South Africans, who are having to make great sacrifices.

“None of us – not least a member of the National Executive – should undermine our national effort to save lives in this very serious situation. I am satisfied that Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams appreciates the seriousness of what she has done and that no-one is above the law,” Ramaphosa said. Minister in The Presidency Jackson Mthembu will act in Ndabeni-Abrahams’ position.
