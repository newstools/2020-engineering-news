Executive directors and senior managers of pharmaceutical company Adcock Ingram will follow the lead of President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Cabinet and donate a portion of their salaries for the next three months to the Solidarity Fund. Adcock Ingram CEO Andy Hall urges individuals and companies in South Africa, who have the financial means, to heed the call of the President, like many other companies and individuals have already done. “The contributions thus far to the Solidarity Fund are clear evidence that as a country, if we all work together; we can overcome the bleak realities that we are currently faced with.” The company says in a statement it applauds the President and his Cabinet on the swift and decisive action that has been implemented in the management of Covid-19 to contain the outbreak of the virus in an effort to prevent further loss of lives. Adcock Ingram also thanks public and private sector healthcare workers, emergency personnel, police and military personnel, and other persons who are delivering essential services to South Africa. The company, being an integral part of the healthcare system and the medicine supply chain in South Africa, reiterates its commitment to the country, as well its responsibility, along with other pharmaceutical companies, to ensure that there is an uninterrupted supply of medicines, particularly life-saving medicines such as intravenous fluids and antiretrovirals, as well as the many acute medicines that are used to treat Covid-19. In this regard, Hall points out that its critical care staff worked throughout the Easter weekend to ensure the country remains fully supplied with life-saving intravenous fluids.
