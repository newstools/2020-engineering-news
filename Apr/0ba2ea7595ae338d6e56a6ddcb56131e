“South Africa has boldly taken the right steps to avoid the high number of coronavirus-related deaths experienced by many countries; we just need to stay strong, stay healthy and stay at home,” is the message infrastructure and construction company Concor CEO Lucas Tseki has sent, as the country enters an extended lockdown for another two weeks. “This is an historic challenge facing the planet, and we are all called upon to make our own contribution in these difficult and uncertain time. The current crisis highlights more than ever how interconnected we all are – across communities, countries and continents. We are all in this together, and must act responsibly toward a common goal of stemming the spread of the virus,” he adds. He commended President Cyril Ramaphosa for “his grit and courageous leadership in the face of adversity”, noting that the decision to extend the national lockdown could not have been easy. The lockdown’s impact on business was clearly front-of-mind for decision-makers, but the global spread of the deadly virus demanded that tough choices be made, he noted. “For Concor’s executive team, our primary focus at the moment is the group’s sustainability, so we continue to engage our business partners and explore opportunities within the market. "We are doing everything possible to mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus including preparation for responsible resumption of operations post the lockdown – and we are confident that together we will weather this unprecedented storm.”
