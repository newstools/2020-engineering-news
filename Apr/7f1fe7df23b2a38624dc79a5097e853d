The University of Johannesburg Vice Chancellor Professor Tshilidzi Marwala has revealed that he will donate 33% of his salary to the Solidarity Fund to help fight the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. This follows President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that members of Cabinet will donate one-third of their salaries towards Solidarity Fund. Business leaders such as Nedbank CEO Mike Brown, Rhodes University Vice Chancellor Sizwe Mabizela and politicians, including the Economic Freedom Fighters’ public representatives, have also headed the call. In a statement Marwala said it was an easy decision to make as the pandemic required leadership and personal sacrifices. “The pandemic is, without doubt, a defining global crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced in a long time. South Africa, like many other countries globally, has been left with no option but to impose drastic measures such as large-scale quarantines, travel restrictions and complete lockdowns. In a country fraught with inequality and poverty, with an almost 30% unemployment rate, the stakes are considerably higher,” he said. He added for the virus to ultimately pass and for the situation to improve, leadership and personal sacrifices were needed.
