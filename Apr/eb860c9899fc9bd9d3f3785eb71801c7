Volvo Trucks Southern Africa says it will support transport companies that are delivering essential services during the Covid-19 lockdown in South Africa. “We are indeed living in extraordinary times and I want to assure customers that Volvo Trucks, together with our nationwide network, is doing everything we can to continue servicing essential transport fleets during this difficult time,” says Volvo Group Southern Africa VP Marcus Hörberg. “To ensure that fleet owners can continue their vital work, our teams are working tirelessly to monitor parts, workshop and Volvo Action Service readiness around the clock. “Our breakdown service team has implemented strict safety measures so that our technicians can work in shifts and be on standby to keep trucks on the road. “Rest assured that we are focusing every effort to secure uptime for our customers’ businesses in this critical time.” Through Volvo Action Service, transport operators have access to a 24/7 assistance service, which can be reached by contacting 0860 112 212 from anywhere in South Africa. The team will be working remotely, but will be able to arrange support for customers when they need it, such as providing technicians during breakdowns and product engineers if further assistance is required. As per government’s guidelines, the company’s parts distribution centre will be closed, but will be available if emergency parts are required. Hörberg says that some of the company’s suppliers are on complete lockdown, which will affect services such as wheel alignment, radiator cleaning and engineering of cylinder heads, and so forth. “We are, however, committed to do our utmost to keep the wheels of the transport industry turning to deliver essential goods and services to communities across South Africa,” notes Hörberg. “The Volvo Trucks team is working around the clock to ensure that we support government’s efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19.”
