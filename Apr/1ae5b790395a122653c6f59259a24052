Trade union Solidarity says the Department of Small Business Development (DSBD) has given the union an undertaking in court papers not to continue using race as a criteria when it grants assistance to businesses, but legal action continues with the Department of Tourism (DoT). The DoT argued in court papers that it would continue to use race as criterion for granting assistance. The matter between the union and the tourism department will be heard in the Northern Gauteng High Court in April 28. Solidarity CE Dr Dirk Hermann says it would seem that government is divided against itself when it comes to using race as criterion for granting assistance during the Covid-19 crisis. Solidarity lodged a complaint against the DSBD and the DoT with the South African Human Rights Commission on March 25, after the government had indicated that emergency funds will be allocated on the basis of race. In opposing documents, the DSBD gave final confirmation that race is not a criterion for eligibility for emergency funding. According to them, the questions regarding race on their online application form are merely for statistical records. Solidarity calls on businesses that do not receive funding because of race to call Solidarity urgently. “Although we won the battle against the DSBD, we are still engaged in the fight against the DoT. The Tourism Department’s defence is that they must still comply with black economic empowerment requirements. “The coronavirus does not discriminate, and the need has not arisen because of race. However, unlike the virus, the tourism department has decided to discriminate on the basis of race,” Hermann says.
