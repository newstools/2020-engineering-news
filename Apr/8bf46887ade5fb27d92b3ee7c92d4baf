Responding to a call for help from the Gauteng Department of Health, BMW Group South Africa’s (BMW SA) has donated 40 000 protective respiratory (FFP2) face masks to the Gauteng government to assist health-service workers in their fight against Covid-19. FFP2 masks have a minimum of 94% filtration percentage and maximum 8% leakage to the inside. They are mainly used in construction, agriculture, and by healthcare professionals against influenza viruses. They are currently used for protection against the coronavirus. BMW SA says it has also opened 15 dealerships across the country to service and repair essential service vehicles, which includes vehicles used by the South African Police Service, various Metro Police departments, medical personnel and private essential service workers. BMW says ‘On Call’, its 24-hour roadside assistance operation, is also functioning during lockdown. The group has handled more than 900 calls since the start of the lockdown. “We’re all doing our best to manage the impact of this virus on our businesses and communities,” says BMW Group South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa CEO Tim Abbott. “We’ve been building cars in South Africa since 1973 and we’re part of the fabric of this country. Our first priority is to care for the health and wellbeing of our associates, and I’m so glad we’re able to keep the wheels of essential services turning at this time of crisis, and that we’ve been able to support the Gauteng Department of Health.”
