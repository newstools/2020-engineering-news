The Port Elizabeth Car Terminal has aced the Volkswagen group’s global quality audit, scoring 96% across sections such as export processes, housekeeping, security, vehicle handling, as well as condition of storage, says Transnet Port Terminals (TPT). The audit is held every five years across all sites that handle the German car manufacturer’s import and export vehicles. “The achievement speaks to the rarely celebrated employees that carry out their work with utmost commitment and pride to a point where they elevate the country’s name internationally,” says TPT. Volkswagen Group South Africa manufactures the Polo and Polo Vivo models at its plant in Uitenhage, about 35 km north west of Port Elizabeth. The car maker has been exporting these models to destinations such as the European Union for about 14 years. TPT says it has seen steady growth at the Port Elizabeth Car Terminal, with September and November the best exporting months in the current financial year. There are more than 40 car manufacturers operating in South Africa across the passenger, light- and heavy-commercial markets, exporting to more than 155 markets.
