Bidvest Panalpina Logistics (BPL) has announced a name change and a change in partner. BPL will split from DSV/Panalpina after 46 years of commercial partnership, and will, in future, trade as Bidvest International Logistics (BIL), once all regulatory changes have been completed. BIL is owned by the Bidvest group (89%) and the Makana Investment Corporation (MIC, 11%). Bidvest and MIC have been partners for the past 20 years. MIC was established by the late, former President Nelson Mandela, to look after the families of former political prisoners. BIL says it has also joined forces with EMO Trans Global Logistics (EMO Trans) as its global forwarding network partner. Through this exclusive agency partnership, BIL’s global reach will extend to 335 network offices in more than 140 countries. EMO Trans and MIC’s operating business, Sebenza Forwarding, have also worked together for the past 20 years, with EMO Trans developing an understanding of the South African landscape through this partnership. BIL provides end-to-end supply-chain solutions across a number of different industries and offers international import and export services, using road, sea and air. When products arrive in South Africa, BIL is able to clear, warehouse, fulfil and distribute through final mile distributing services.
