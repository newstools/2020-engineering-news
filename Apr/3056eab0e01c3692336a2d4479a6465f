South Africa’s dam water levels increased marginally from 66.8% to 67% week-on-week, the average boosted by rising dam levels in the Free State. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) weekly report shows Gauteng has the highest dam levels in the country, with its water storage full, followed by the Northern Cape at 91% and Mpumalanga at 75%. “However, Gauteng and Northern Cape have the smallest dams that get filled up quickly by the rains. At the end of April South Africa will reach the end of its hydrological season when summer gives ways to the cold and dry winter,” the DWS said in a statement on April 3. The Free State, which has some of the biggest dams in the country, recorded a dam level average of 76.9%. Gariep dam rose by a percent from 93.3% to 94.4% week-on-week, suggesting sufficient water for basic use and for the generation of electricity in winter when there will be no rain. Dam levels in the Western Cape, which were just 41.7% full over the past week, are expected to be boosted by heavy downpours over the next few months. In Mpumalanga, the listed dams and the water management areas recorded slight improvements in water volumes over the week, with dam levels increasing from 74.7% to 75% week-on-week.
