The technical solutions implemented in Ivolga passenger trains, made in Russia by rail and urban transport manufacturer Transmashholding (TMH), are helping to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and other infections. All Ivolga passenger electric trains feature a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system with an air sanitising feature. These systems use ultraviolet (UV) lamps with bactericidal qualities to treat the passing air with UV radiation against viruses and bacteria before letting it out into the passenger area. “UV radiation destroys up to 99% of microorganisms. Passengers of our trains breathe the air that has been sanitised and, therefore, have a lower chance of exposure to disease-inducing microorganisms. "During the period of increased coronavirus threat, the sanitizing systems will remain engaged during mainline operations as well as on maintenance in the depots,” said TMH product and technical marketing head Valeria Sharafutdinova. With their pass-through design, Ivolga trains allow passengers to move inside the train and retain a safe physical distance. The lavatories in the head cars use motion sensors to turn faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers on and off. These measures amount to a reduced possibility of passengers being in contact with a contaminated surface. All electric passenger trains currently produced by TMH carry sanitising equipment and comply with health and safety regulations currently in effect. TMH is a Russian company headquartered in Moscow with international offices in Switzerland, Hungary, South Africa, Egypt, Argentina, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The holding incorporates 15 manufacturing sites.
