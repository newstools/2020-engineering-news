South African business representative body Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has appointed Cas Coovadia CEO, effective April 1. He has been serving as acting CEO since Tanya Cohen stepped down in July 2019. Coovadia recently stepped down as MD of the Banking Association South Africa after 15 years. “Cas comes to Busa as its CEO after serving many years as an anti-apartheid activist and then representing broader South African business. He brings a wealth of organisation and strategic experience and skills, which are critical for business and the country,” says Busa president Sipho Pityana. He notes that the Busa board thanks Coovadia for delaying his retirement to continue to contribute to the country’s growth and development.
