From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Shannon de Ryhove: Automotive component manufacturer Bosal Afrika in February officially opened its new emissions control systems manufacturing plant, in Pretoria, which is supplying major original-equipment manufacturers including Ford, Nissan, Isuzu and Volkswagen, in South Africa. Marleny Arnoldi attended the launch. Marleny Arnoldi: Bosal invested about R25-million to relocate the ECS plant that was previously joined with the company’s first facility down the road, which is now a dedicated automotive carrier and protection system manufacturing facility. The new 18 000 m2 plant produces exhausts, heat exchangers, silencers and manifolds for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Bosal Afrika MD Danie van Vuuren tells us more about the activities and customers of the facility. Bosal Afrika MD Danie van Vuuren: Marleny Arnoldi: Bosal International chairperson Karel Bos says the new ECS facility has set a standard for the global Bosal group, owing to its lean manufacturing layout and better efficiencies. Van Vuuren elaborates. Bosal Afrika MD Danie van Vuuren: Marleny Arnoldi: Bosal plans to start manufacturing towbars for export to Europe over the next two to three years, which will require further investment in production equipment. In the meantime, Van Vuuren explains how the company will expand its product portfolio for hot- and cold-end products.
