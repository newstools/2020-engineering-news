The Port of East London continues to facilitate the movement of critical cargo, related to the supply and distribution of essential goods (such as food, fuel and chemicals), during the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown in South Africa. Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) East London port manager Sharon Sijako says the port has been in frequent discussions with representatives from the provincial and local government, and all other critical stakeholders, with regard to port operations. “To date, all has gone well, and our stakeholders are appreciative of the partnership during these challenging times,” she comments. Two vessels docked on April 17, the first being a container vessel – mv HSL Paraty – to discharge and load food products, chemicals and automotive components. This was followed by the bulk carrier – mv Jorita – with a consignment of wheat, which Sijako notes was “extremely critical” given the country’s present wheat shortages. Both vessels were on maiden voyage calls to the port. While South Africa’s government has relaxed some of its initial Covid-19 regulations to improve the flow of cargo through the ports, the initial regulations stipulated that only essential goods could be moved through the ports, but Sijako notes that this led to terminals becoming congested with imported goods that were not essential goods. Subsequently, the regulations were amended to enable the flow of cargo to enable ports to clear cargo congestion. In the most recent regulations, which were announced after the lockdown extension, there is a provision for goods that are currently in ports to be exported, to further reduce any potential congestion. While the Port of East London’s automotive terminal was provisionally closed in line with Transnet’s decision to minimise any potential Covid-19 virus spread by reducing non-essential operations at its terminals, all the port’s terminals in East London have since resumed restricted operations to support the economy.
