The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) has tweaked its systems to ensure that more pertinent information is available on its online platform. Employers, employees and organised labour are now able to see which companies have been paid. This follows a number of queries where workers have been unable to determine if their companies have applied for, and received payment, on their behalf from the Department of Employment and Labour's Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme. The greater amount of information available on the online UIF platform greatly relieves the overwhelmed call centre that has been used to date, the department says. Employers will be able to log and check the status of their claims, while also being able to see the schedule of the approved claim, which shows how much is due to each employee. Additionally, employers who do not know their UIF reference number can retrieve it by using their Pay-As-You-Earn number. “As a public service institution, it is our duty to ensure that we listen to our stakeholders and to the extent possible, to make the necessary enhancements so that those who consume our services do so with relative ease and minimal issues. “We continue to listen to our stakeholders and we will make further enhancement to the system in response to the identified needs of our stakeholders,” says UIF commissioner Teboho Maruping. The UIF has paid just over R5-billion in combined normal and Covid-19 benefits since April 16, of which R4.1-billion was paid as Covid-19 relief benefits. About 72 221 claims by employers have been successfully paid. However, about 55 169 employers’ claims, representing about 361 000 workers, are still not finalised, owing to pending submission of certain particulars by employers.
