The Port Elizabeth Container Terminal (PECT) has taken delivery of two new mobile harbour cranes from equipment manufacture Liebherr. “The arrival of these two modern cranes will ensure that our promise to industry is realised,” says Transnet Port Terminal (TPT) acting CE Michelle Phillips. She adds that the cranes arrived at a critical time when the company’s terminals nationwide were prioritising the movement of much-needed goods in the Eastern Cape, South Africa and abroad. “We are at the start of the 2020 citrus season and we are very pleased that we are able to contribute positively towards the growth of this economy, especially during these challenging times,” says Phillips. The cranes have multi-use capability, can lift up to 104 t and move up and down the quayside according to berth activity – boasting an ability to handle new Panamax container and Cape size bulk vessels alike. They are also designed for versatile and efficient cargo handling. “A simulator has been on site for the past month with Liebherr providing training to our employees . . . and we are quite impressed with the skills employees are demonstrating,” says Phillips. She adds that both customers and employees have been looking forward to these two pieces of equipment, which arrived as semi-knocked down units. “We look forward to the commissioning of these cranes and to an improved operation in the PECT.” The mobile harbour cranes are part of TPT's R2-billion equipment investment this year and are a response to industry calls for equipment that will improve performance across its operations.
