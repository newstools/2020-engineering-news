The Innovation Hub of Gauteng has called on entrepreneurs and researchers in the information and communication technology (ICT), green, biotech and medical industries to enter the annual Gauteng Accelerator Programme (GAP) Innovation Competition before July 10. The hub also urged those driving township economies to enter the competition. The qualifying entrants will be invited to an awards ceremony during the annual Global Entrepreneurship Week event, which will be hosted in November. The event sees countries from around the world connecting with entrepreneurs, researchers, mentors and stakeholder groups to develop a network of synergistic partners and new opportunities. The GAP Innovation Competition has been running for nine years, seeking novel ideas that will improve the efficiency of government service delivery, increase the competitiveness of the local economy and enhance the quality of life for citizens. The categories for entries are ICT, medical, biosciences, green economy and township economy. These five categories of GAP’s innovation competition have since its inception in 2011 attracted more than 1 200 entries and invested more than R17-million in seed funding and incubation support to 91 startups. Once selections have been made, candidates will undergo an intensive training course for a year at the Innovation Hub’s business incubator sites, which is done through business workshops hosted by leaders in the technology entrepreneurship field. The candidates will be exposed to information around strategies, business model development, funding channels, pitching workshops, product pricing methods, effective presentation skills and the composition of effective teams. Finalists will be selected by an independent panel of judges based on their business strategy, technology, market, the team members and impact of the technology.
