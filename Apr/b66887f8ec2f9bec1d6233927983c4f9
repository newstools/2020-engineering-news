While 14 737 of the planned 18 875 tanks have been delivered to all provinces across South Africa, only 7 689 tanks have been installed four weeks after the declaration of a state of disaster. The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation and the Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, in a joint sitting on April 21, called for the immediate installation of all tanks to ensure provision of water to people. “While we welcome the extent of the work done up to now, urgency is needed to ensure that all allocated tanks are operational,” said Portfolio Committee chairperson Machwene Semenya. Various areas, such as UMkhanyakude and QwaQwa, are still without water, which impacts on the ability of residents to maintain the necessary hygiene. “We are of the view that the installation of all the allocated tanks will ensure that water provision is improved. We will require a weekly update on installation of these tanks, because delivering tanks alone is not enough; people must get water,” added Select Committee chairperson China Dodovu. Meanwhile, the committees welcomed the assurance that the Department of Water and Sanitation is also focusing on infrastructure development and investment to ensure long-term sustainable water provision after the intervention phase. “In relation to funding, both committees are cognisant that, owing to the need to reprioritise the Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant funding, there will be delays in implementing projects initially identified for the 2020/21 financial year,” the committees said in a joint statement. Budget cuts have been equitable across provinces, with those that get the largest allocation receiving the largest cuts, which the committees believe will ensure minimal impact in delivery of projects.
