The South African government plans to finalise, by April 20, its post-Covid-19 economic recovery plan, as well as a resolution on South African Airways (SAA). The Cabinet on April 15 hosted a virtual special Cabinet meeting to discuss the socioeconomic recovery plan once the Covid-19 lockdown ends. The meeting discussed five presentations from the Ministerial Clusters including the economic sectors, investment, employment and infrastructure development; governance, State capacity and institutional development; social protection, community and human development; international cooperation, trade and security; and justice, crime prevention and security. The presentations were a culmination of work done by all the clusters around the country’s economic recovery as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent downgrading of South Africa’s investment ratings by agencies Moody’s and Fitch, respectively. A statement from the Presidency on April 16 confirmed that further discussions and consultations were required before a final consolidated plan could be approved and published. The Cabinet Clusters have been asked to work together to produce one consolidated document on key priorities of the country’s economic recovery plan, which should be complete before the next Cabinet meeting on April 20. The upcoming meeting will also discuss a report by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on SAA. A recent request by SAA for further funding from government has been denied and it is likely that the airline may now have to close.
