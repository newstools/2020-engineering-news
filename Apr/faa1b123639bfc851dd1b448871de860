Portable building manufacturer Speedspace has supplied 37 mobile quarantine units to the Department of Correctional Services for use during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company mobilised and began preparing the units on March 25, with all units delivered on April 8. In total, 1 700 m2 of quarantine space was provided, the equivalent of 168 rooms. The mobile parkhome-type units are 12 m x 3 m, fully insulated and fitted with basic electrical fittings and burglar-proofed aluminium windows. Speedspace delivered a combination of mobile isolation units and mobile ablutions, which includes showers and bathrooms to seven different sites, including Modimolle, Polokwane, Vereeniging, Bloemfontein, Upington, Port Elizabeth and Queenstown. The units are being leased and were supplied from Speedspace’s Johannesburg, Northern Cape and Port Elizabeth branches. In addition to providing the units, Speedspace’s scope of work also includes the establishment of external water and electrical reticulation for the units. Speedspace MD Hennie Wigget notes that, because the units are only being used for quarantine, no special modifications were required. “If people need medical attention they would need to be moved to hospitals.” He explains that the parkhome-type units are fully insulated and used across a range of applications, such as offices, schools and accommodation, across Southern Africa. The units are also used in the health and mining sectors. “The mobility of our product, as well as the speed at which we can mobilise and deliver to various destinations, makes this product ideal for this application.” Should government not have a need for these units after the pandemic, Speedspace will collect them.
