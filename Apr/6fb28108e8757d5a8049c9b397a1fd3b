The International Air Transport Association (Iata) announced on April 15 that it was offering free online training courses for as many as 5 000 aviation workers. This was one of its initiatives to help the commercial aviation industry overcome the current crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “In a salute to the women and men of this industry, Iata is making a small contribution to support the sector’s recovery with free training,” explained Iata director of training Stéphanie Siouffi. “These are tough times but we wanted to see the opportunity of [sic] the future, and what better way than through learning.” The training courses are open both to current aviation sector workers and to those who want to join the aviation and aviation-related sectors. The courses will be awarded on a first-come-first served basis, up to a maximum number of 5 000. Applications had to be submitted before April 27. Six different e-learning courses are being offered. These cover aviation competition law; destination geography; a professional approach to travel agency fees; accounting and financial management for travel agencies; geography in travel planning; and distribution and airline retailing. This training opportunity is being offered as part of the continuing #WeAreAviation campaign. This is in support of the men and women who form the aviation community, and to highlight their passion for what Iata described as “the business of freedom”. “Aviation will make it through the Covid-19 crisis,” affirmed Siouffi. “That’s because, as with past crises, the many great people of this industry will pull together to face the challenges head-on.” Iata is the representative body for the global commercial aviation industry. Its membership is composed of some 290 airlines which are together responsible for 82% of the world’s air traffic.
