As a result of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Aim-listed independent, East Africa-focused natural gas company Wentworth is delaying the release of its full year financial results, which were due to be released on April 8, to later in the month. The company was also compelled by the level of business and economic uncertainty and the financial conduct authority’s guidance on the publication of results during this time. In line with its announcement on March 10, Wentworth’s board of executives expects the full results for the year ended December 31, 2019, to be in line with management expectations. “Our operations continue unaffected by Covid-19 and, with our strong cash position and consistent payments for gas sales, we remain fully committed to the previously indicated dividend policy,” the company reported on April 8.
