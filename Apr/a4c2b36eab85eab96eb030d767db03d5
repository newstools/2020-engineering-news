IFAT Africa, the trade fair for water, sewage, refuse and recycling in sub-Saharan Africa, will be back in Johannesburg in 2021, with an expanded African reach and a range of new highlights. With water, waste management and recycling now more important than ever before, IFAT Africa will showcase key solutions from around the world, the organisers say. A high-calibre forum programme will be addressing various trends, challenges and solutions from the water, sewage, refuse and recycling sectors, bringing together public and private sector, solution providers, academics, practitioners and decision-makers for three days of knowledge sharing. Highlights of the event also include focused masterclasses hosted by the Water Institute of Southern Africa (WISA) and Institute of Waste Management of Southern Africa (IWMSA), the third edition of the University Challenge, product demonstrations and an interactive corner. IFAT Africa 2019 featured 172 exhibitors from 19 countries and over 3 300 visitors from across Africa, from countries including Botswana, Cameroon, Cote dâ€™ Ivoire, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Co-located with analytica Lab Africa and food & drink technology Africa, the events occupied 17 000 m2 spread over four halls and an outdoor exhibition area, where a total of 385 exhibitors presented their solutions and products to 8 324 visitors, creating the largest industry specific trade fair in Southern Africa, focusing on analysis, laboratory equipment, water treatment and technologies, food and beverage processing, waste management and recycling. Next year, Messe Muenchen South Africa will again co-locate the three events at Gallagher Convention Centre, from July 13 to 15, 2021.
