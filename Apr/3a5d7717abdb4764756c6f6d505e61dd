The Solidarity e-Race, created to support the relief efforts provided by the Solidarity Fund to small and medium-sized enterprises, and organised by Afrihost, Data Sciences Corporation, Pure Storage and NEC, has kicked off. "While we are fully aware that South Africans are passionate about their cars and motorsport and even more so about their country, it is amazing to see how many people came together to support this race and its cause. "Even more exciting is the fact that now we will be heading into the semi-finals and final race where we will get to see talented drivers, both simulated racers and real racers, battle it out for the top of the podium," says Voice of Choice commentator Greg Moloney. The qualifying sessions were held on the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit from April 9 to 14. More than 135 registered racers completed over 23 000 laps or 104 232 km – roughly two-and-a-half times round the world. The Solidarity e-Race team has identified the fastest 100 pilots which will be split in four different races for the semi-finals, based on their qualifying times. The drivers will be allocated races via lucky draw. The semi-final races will begin at 19:00 on April 14. Each race will last for ten laps and the six fastest drivers from each race will qualify for the grand final taking place at 19:00 on April 15. The races will be live-streamed on YouTube and Facebook with commentary from Moloney and guests.
