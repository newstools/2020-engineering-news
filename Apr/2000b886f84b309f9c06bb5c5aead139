Alternative building solutions company Trumod will donate temporary relief structures this week to communities that have been affected by displacements during Covid-19. This will be done in partnership with the City of Ekurhuleni. The company will donate several of its Tru-Khaya temporary relief structures to supplement government's efforts and spearhead the use of alternative building solutions in response to the pandemic, says Trumod MD Peter Thompson. The pandemic has been worsened by a fire that caused many to lose their homes in Alexandra, along with people displaced in Ruimsig and Ekurhuleni prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. While the South African government is working on systematic interventions, there lies an opportunity to respond in a manner similar to China's response by building an emergency hospital in ten days that will ensure that healthcare facilities are not overwhelmed and that there is ample capacity in every major hub to deal with the pandemic, Thompson says. Alternative building methods provide a solution to this pandemic; from large-scale, multilevel medical facilities to more specialised health pods. Alternative building methods also allow for shorter construction timelines compared to traditional brick and mortar building methods. "Our solutions range from simple tents to sophisticated independent units and comply with World Health Organisation requirements for proper ventilation, human flow, distancing and cleanability. Trumod has begun work on a 150-bed intensive care unit hospital in Gauteng," says Thompson. Trumod also manufactures fire-retardant, temporary-relief accommodation to ensure that the most vulnerable of society can be housed during these challenging times.
