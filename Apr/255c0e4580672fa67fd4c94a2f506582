The South African Reserve Bank has cut the repo rate by 100 basis points, or one percentage point. This brings South Africa's repo rate to 4.25%. Tuesday's announcement was the second major cut in less than a month, after the bank cut the rate by one percentage point in mid-March. "The May 2020 meeting of the MPC was moved earlier and took place today," the bank said in a tweet. The repo rate is the benchmark interest rate at which the Reserve Bank lends money to other banks.
