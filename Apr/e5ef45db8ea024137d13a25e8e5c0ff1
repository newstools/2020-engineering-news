Information and communication technology company EOH, and its subsidiary iOCO, mobilised its teams and built a Web presence for the Solidarity Fund in under 48 hours following a call from government. The project was undertaken on a pro bono basis as part of the group’s ongoing support and commitment to stop the spread of Covid-19. The Solidarity Fund is a rapid response vehicle through which pooled contributions can be deployed to fund four key initiatives – preventive and supportive measures to “flatten the curve” by lowering infection rates, detecting and understanding the magnitude of the infection problem, assisting with the management of those people in hospital or under medical care, and supporting those people whose lives are disrupted by Covid-19. Through this fund, individuals and organisations are able to support these efforts through secure, tax-deductible donations. The fund is administered through professional managers and organisations in the private sector. EOH CEO Stephen van Coller says that, in response to the threat of the Covid-19, the most effective weapon is solidarity. “Those who are healthy need to protect those who are at risk, and those who have the intellectual and financial resources need to use them to support those without. I have, in my personal capacity, donated to the Solidarity Fund, and I urge those of you with the wherewithal to do so to join me.”
