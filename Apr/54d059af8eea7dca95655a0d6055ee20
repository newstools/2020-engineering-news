Telecom-focused energy service company Energy Vision is deploying purpose-built power systems for outdoor telecom sites across Nigeria and Gabon. The group ordered Swedish technology company eSite Power Systems’ eSite x10 as it expands its African operations into Nigeria, with additional power systems to be deployed in Gabon. The manufacturing of the eSites is ongoing in Sweden, with shipments to Nigeria and Gabon planned before the end of the month. Pre-equipped to use solar energy, the eSites will be used to provide stable and dependable power at cell sites where the electricity grid supply is unreliable or unavailable. Remote management system is enabled through eSite Tools, which will monitor, control and accurately report back to Energy Vision's in-country network operations centres on the key performance indicators of each site. “We aim to lead the telecom energy service market in Africa, deploying the most innovative and technologically advanced infrastructure in order to offer our customers the highest possible power availability and service level agreements at the lowest possible total cost of ownership,” said Energy Vision CEO Ofer Ahiraz. eSite Power Systems and Energy Vision have worked together on previous successful projects in Gabon and Burkina Faso. “Our ruggedised eSite x10 has proven itself to be the ideal site power solution to cope with Africa’s environmental challenges,” said eSite Power Systems CEO Mattias Karlsson, noting that energy-as-a-service demands the highest levels of performance and reliability from telecom site power systems.
