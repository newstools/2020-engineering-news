The City of Johannesburg (CoJ) says customers will still receive their municipal bills during lockdown, but through SMS notifications with a link to view their statements. These statements are normally sent through the South African Post Office or by email for those registered on the city’s e-services platform. The SMSes will contain a link to the customer’s statement which can be viewed through a secure portal or sent by email, as per the customer’s preference. Should customers feel the need to validate the SMS, they may visit the CoJ’s e-services platform on www.joburg.org.za or register to receive their municipal statements by email. The CoJ says that, apart from the obvious benefit of people still receiving their statements, other benefits include that customers will receive their statements almost immediately once billed, they can view it from anywhere they are and pay immediately as well. Customers also will not experience the inconvenience of delayed postage services.
