Professional body for the global regulatory and financial crime community, the International Compliance Association (ICA), has partnered with training and advisory firm Navigate Compliance to bring ICA education to South Africa. Navigate Compliance is a 100% women- and youth-owned small, medium-sized and microenterprise specialising in regulatory compliance training and consultancy, working alongside professional bodies, corporates and higher education institutions in South Africa. The partnership brings ICA’s full suite of qualifications to the region and will include localised content in many courses, as well as international best practice. The launch comes at a time when the Financial Action Task Force’s latest Mutual Evaluation Report is due to be released, enhancing the scrutiny of the country’s approach to managing financial crime risk. According to the South African Financial Intelligence Centre, although regulations have been recently strengthened, the country is still losing between $10-billion and $25-billion a year in illicit financial flows. “At Navigate Compliance, we believe that a globally informed compliance function is the key to navigating the ever-changing regulatory landscape and the proactive management of emerging threats. "Through the ICA partnership, we hope to provide learners with a platform to participate on a global scale while providing opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge on an ongoing basis,” says Navigate Compliance learning and development head Sholane Sathu.
