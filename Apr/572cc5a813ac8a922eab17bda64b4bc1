Alibaba founder Jack Ma has announced the donation of another batch of medical supplies to each of the 54 African countries, through the Jack Ma Foundation. In March, the Foundation had announced their commitment to donating 100 000 medical masks, 20 000 test kits and 1 000 protective suits and face shields to each country. The latest donation includes 500 ventilators, 200 000 suits and face shields, 2 000 thermometers, 1-million swabs and extraction kits, and 500 000 gloves. The supplies will be transported with the assistance of the Foundation’s partners, the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Food Programme and Ethiopian Airlines. Moreover, the Jack Ma Foundation and Alibaba Foundation are aiming to connect African medical professionals with doctors from China and around the world to collaborate online and exchange lessons learnt in the treatment and prevention of Covid-19. The magnate said he was hoping Africans were staying healthy and safe during this difficult time. The  World Health Organisation recently voiced concerns about the rising numbers of infected people in the continent. Africa has 9 198 coronavirus cases, with 414 deaths across the continent.
