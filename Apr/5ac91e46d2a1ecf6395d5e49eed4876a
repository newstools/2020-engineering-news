Household goods retailer Spar has launched a new 100% recyclable 2 ℓ milk carton, which is made from 87% renewable resources. The entire carton closure, including the cap, is made from plant-based material, and the board used to make the cartons, comes from responsibly-managed forests that are Forest Stewardship Council-certified. According to Spar, the unbleached board, with naturally brown fibres, offers greater strength, resulting in a stronger yet lighter carton. This is part of a wider shift from a linear to circular economy, which emphasises the importance of recycling and the reduction of waste. Spar house brands manager Paul Mindry says the Spar 2 ℓ full cream and low-fat extended shelf life milk is “more sustainable and kinder to the environment, enabling consumers to make environmentally responsible choices every time they shop”. Spar has included recycling information on the cartons to help consumers in their commitment to making a positive change in South Africa.
