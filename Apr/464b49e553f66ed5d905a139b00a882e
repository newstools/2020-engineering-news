Data-only network provider rain and Pargo have teamed up to make rain sim cards available at over 100 pick-up points at selected Clicks stores. The sim cards, which are traditionally ordered online and delivered, will be available for pick-up by customers at the Clicks-based Pargo pick-up points during South Africa’s Covid-19 lockdown period. “We have seen a surge in demand for our unlimited data-only plans. Unlimited data is something many South Africans can use right now,” said rain chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga. “At rain, we are doing everything we can to help South Africans to keep doing their thing – whether that is working, streaming, sharing or chatting.” While customers can still choose to have their sim cards delivered to their door, the partnership with Pargo should give more South Africans access to the affordable, unlimited data. “South Africans who can not wait for courier delivery of their rain sim can click the ‘find sim’ button on the rain website. There, they will enter their home address to find their closest participating Pargo pick-up point on an interactive map,” Dlanga explained. Pargo has instituted strict hygiene protocols at all pick-up points and have made the health of their customers and staff a priority. On the rain website, customers can choose from a range of plans, including unlimited fourth-generation data 24/7 for R479 month-to-month or unlimited off-peak which offers 19 hours of unlimited data every day for only R250 a month.
