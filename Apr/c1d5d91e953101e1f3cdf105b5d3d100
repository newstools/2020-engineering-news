As network traffic increases significantly during South Africa’s Covid-19 lockdown, telecommunications giant Vodacom is working to avoid any disruptions. The group has noted a 40% surge in data traffic on the network compared with pre-lockdown levels, attributed to employees working from home, entertainment and the zero-rating of certain education, government and health sites to assist during the crisis. “We are expecting this trend to continue in the short to medium term as more customers work from home and people use technology to remain connected, educated and entertained,” the company said in an update to shareholders. Vodacom assures that its network can cater for additional demand and, where necessary, can offload capacity onto data-only network provider Rain’s network through its fourth-generation roaming agreement. Further, the company has increased its network investment, with focus on capacity upgrades and batteries, as well as submitted a request for additional temporary spectrum allocation. “This will further ensure that network throughput remains optimal for all customers during this period, while being able to expand into certain underserved areas as well.” While the group has not experienced significant device or hardware supply disruptions, measures are in place to avoid disruptions. Vodacom is working closely with suppliers and partners in order to maintain critical supplies during this period. “Where possible we have stockpiled some critical network and device elements to ensure that the network can remain available, while ensuring that customers will get access to devices while working from home,” it said.
