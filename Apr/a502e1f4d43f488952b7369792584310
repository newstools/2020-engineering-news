The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has received 35 applications for the emergency spectrum it intends temporarily releasing during South Africa’s state of disaster. Icasa last week said it would temporarily release the high-demand International Mobile Telecommunications spectrum as telecommunications demand surges amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The deadline to apply was April 9. The spectrum available for temporary assignment includes the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 2 300 MHz, 2 600 MHz and 3 500 MHz bands. “The authority would like to inform all stakeholders that it is currently applying its mind and analysing all applications to ensure compliance with the criteria and conditions stipulated in Annexure A of the regulations,” Icasa said in a statement. “The authority hereby reiterates that it intends to take the necessary care and ensure that the release of the spectrum for use on an emergency basis is fair and non-discriminatory.” The decisions will be announced within the next week.
