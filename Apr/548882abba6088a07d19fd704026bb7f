The World Green Building Council (WGBC) has partnered with filmmaker BBC StoryWorks to deliver a landmark film series. The series will air on the BBC television network between September and December. Since buildings have a profound effect on the quality of people’s lives, the aim of the series is to explore ways in which companies can design, build and operate buildings differently to improve the health of people and the planet. The WGBC says people spend more than 90% of their time in buildings and that 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions come from buildings and construction. “The series will bring to screen building projects from around the world, which are charting the innovative ways in which organisations are turning rhetoric into action when it comes to healthy and sustainable buildings. “The project aims to galvanise the sector to work collaboratively, aligning stakeholders and creating the right incentives and support for change,” the council explains. BBC StoryWorks says it is excited to embark on the production of a powerful series that will show what buildings are really made of, and why the way in which people use and re-use buildings has such an impact on the environment and the health of society. BBC StoryWorks is the commercial creative arm of BBC Global News.
