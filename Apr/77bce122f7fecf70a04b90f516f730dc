The Sapref refinery, a joint venture between Shell South Africa Refining and BP Southern Africa, has heeded the call for corporates to donate their personal protective equipment (PPE) stock to the healthcare sector. This comes amid a shortage of masks and other PPE needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Sapref has donated 4 000 FFP2-standard masks and 100 goggles to The Bluff and Isipingo clinics, which serve communities on the fence line of Sapref’s refinery, in KwaZulu-Natal. Sapref MD Victor Bester says the clinics play a critical role in the neighbouring communities and that it is important to assist the clinics with tools to make their work easier to execute.
