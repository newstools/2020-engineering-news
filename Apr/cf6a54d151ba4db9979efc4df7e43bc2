Terminal operator Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) on April 24 reported the fatality of a 47-year-old male port worker at the reefer yard of the Durban Container Terminal Pier 1 the previous night. Operations were immediately suspended. The cause of the incident is unknown at this stage, but the operator confirmed that the South African Police Service has opened an inquest. “A full investigation is under way to identify the root cause of the occurrence. The terminal and its leadership extend their deepest sympathies to the family of the deceased during this difficult time. Operations resumed upon release of the scene by the relevant authorities,” TPT said.
