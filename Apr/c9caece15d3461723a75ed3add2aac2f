The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has delivered 852 water tanks and 20 tankers to water-stressed communities across Gauteng. The department, along with Rand Water and municipalities, are working to provide water to desperate communities in the most densely populated informal settlements to reduce the Covid-19 spread. Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said this a short-term measure to minimise the spread of the infection, with hotspot areas that did not have running water subsequently identified for distribution. “This will alleviate the plight of rural communities who walk long distances to fetch water. Tank water will help destitute communities to wash hands to avoid the infection with the virus,” she said. Roodepoort, Soweto and Ennerdale, in Johannesburg, Hammanskraal, in Tshwane, Benoni, in Ekurhuleni, and other municipalities in the West Rand district municipality all received assistance with water supply. Roodepoort received 100 water tanks with a capacity of 2 500 ℓ, while Soweto received 194 tanks with 2 500 ℓ capacity and 16 tanks with 5 000 ℓ capacity. About 57 water tanks were distributed to Hammanskraal, with 37 having capacity of 2 500 ℓ and the balance a capacity of 5 000 ℓ. The region also received nine water tankers.
