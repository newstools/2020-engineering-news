The Building and Construction Industry Medical Aid Fund (BCIMA) has confirmed it will pay claims for Covid-19, as per its normal scheme rules and benefits, for its members and employers in the building, construction and engineering sectors, as well as in opencast mining. BCIMA CEO Phumelele Makatini says it is now more important than ever for those who work within the building, construction and civil engineering sectors to be able to access the medical care that they may need in the coming weeks. “Now is definitely not the time to leave your employees and their families out in the cold and uncovered – to the contrary, this is the perfect time to go the extra mile for your workforce to ensure that they remain healthy and are ready to return to work once we have weathered the storm. “Once business returns to normality, which it will, you will need your experienced stalwarts and many more capable pairs of hands as it will be all hands on deck to catch up on productive time that has been lost,” she notes. With BCIMA, members are not governed by network restrictions but are instead afforded freedom of choice in selecting healthcare service providers across the board, from private hospitals to traditional healers and homeopaths. The medical scheme offers several one-of-a-kind benefits including a lifetime membership number and the ability to be covered only for the duration of a contract, and benefits tailored to meet the needs of employees who are paid hourly rates. Only the main member pays a contribution while other registered family members are covered for free with contributions based on income.
