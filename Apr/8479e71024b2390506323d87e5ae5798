Identity verification specialist iiDENTIFii says it will financially contribute to the Combatting Covid-19 Fund, launched by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, thereby helping to ease the burden on the less fortunate. The company also donated to this foundation to help it find a medical solution to Covid-19 and better equip the world for potential outbreaks in the future. iiDENTIFii has also committed a percentage of all profits during the lockdown period plus a further three months during the crisis to the South African Solidarity Fund. The Solidarity Fund has been put together to assist the country's most vulnerable communities. It is independently administered and will work with various initiatives to achieve predefined goals, which are to prevent, detect, care and support vulnerable communities throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Donations to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will also support organisations that are working in four critical areas, including developing diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics and helping to protect the most vulnerable populations, particularly in Africa and South Asia.
