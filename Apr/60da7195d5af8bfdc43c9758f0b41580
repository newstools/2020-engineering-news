JSE-listed engineering consumables supplier Hudaco has been approved for a secondary listing on A2X Markets and will start trading on May 5. A2X CEO Kevin Brady says Hudaco is a company with a remarkable 125-year history. “Such longevity is not easily achieved and its listing on A2X is testament to management’s ability to recognise opportunity and adapt to the needs of the marketplace.” The addition of Hudaco to the A2X board will bring the number of securities available for trade on A2X to 37 with a combined market capitalisation of about R2-trillion. “A secondary listing complements a company’s primary listing and comes with no cost, risk or additional regulatory requirements. We believe that every company should be considering a secondary listing,” Brady notes. Hudaco specialises in the importation and distribution of high-quality branded automotive, industrial and electronic consumable products. Hudaco retains its listing on the JSE and its issued share capital will be unaffected by its listing on A2X.
