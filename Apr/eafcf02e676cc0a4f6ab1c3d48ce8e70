The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has committed R250-million to South Africa’s Covid-19 response and has also pledged its support for the African continent through partnerships with the Africa CDC, as well as national public institutions in Africa. The US government has, to date, funded South Africa with more than R410-million, and has noted the 17-year partnership with the country. “This latest injection of assistance is in addition to the approximately $8.4-million (nearly R160-million) in health assistance to support South Africa’s Covid-19 response already committed through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID’s funding is supporting work in strategic information, risk communication, water and sanitation, infection prevention and control, supply chain strengthening for Covid-19 commodities, and public health messaging,” said the US government. Meanwhile, the US said it would continue working closely with its African partners as the virus spreads to dozens of countries, with governments and health authorities across the continent striving to limit widespread infections. The US has provided Africa with more than $65-million in health assistance earmarked for laboratory preparations, case-finding activities and event-based surveillance. Funds will also be used to support technical experts for response and preparedness, risk communication, infection prevention and control.
