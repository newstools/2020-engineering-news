The newly appointed board of control of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) held its first meeting on October 27 and appointed group executive for human capital management Thandeka Mabija acting CEO with immediate effect. She is expected to hold the acting CEO position for a maximum period of three months. The process to recruit a permanent CEO will start immediately. The board will meet again on October 30 to consider PRASA's annual report and financial statements. "The turnaround and stabilisation of PRASA is continuing and being expedited. PRASA is a very important cog in the engine of the South African economy and the passenger rail agency serves the vulnerable in our society. "PRASA is too big and too important to fail. As the board, we will ensure that all that needs to be done is done to bring the agency back to full functionality," chairperson Leonard Tamatlakane said.
