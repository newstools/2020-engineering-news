JSE-listed MTN Group and Telecom Infra Project (TIP) have joined forces to support the evolution of MTN’s communication transport infrastructure, which will become a platform for future revenue growth and profitability. Through the partnership, communication transport capacity will be deployed to support traffic growth over the next three years, as well as provide support for new services as part of the evolution of fifth-generation and new enterprise services. It will also reduce the time to market through more focused agile service provisioning. “Our partnership with TIP will drive the specific requirements of our network to meet our subscriber demands, setting us apart on our network scalability and adaptability,” said MTN Group chief technology and information officer Charles Molapisi. Through the use of open protocols and interfaces, and the ability to incorporate specific innovations focused on the performance of each network component, TIP’s open, disaggregated, standard-based transport networks can help MTN move closer to its ideal transport infrastructure, added TIP chief engineer David Hutton. The TIP community, which aggregates members across the whole transport network value chain, is a key tool for MTN to build its future transport infrastructure. MTN has identified a set of requirements dubbed “CASSI” – Convergent and congestion free, Always on, Scalable, Simplified and Intelligent – to achieve the objective of increasing network efficiency. MTN will work together with the TIP community over the next few months to build transport products and network configurations addressing the company’s requirements, that could be tested and validated in TIP’s community labs and in the field, to create easy-to-use commercial solutions for the CASSI use cases.
