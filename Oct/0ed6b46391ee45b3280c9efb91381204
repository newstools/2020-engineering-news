Brazilian aerospace and defence group Embraer has announced that it delivered a total of 28 commercial and executive jets during the third quarter of this year. These were divided into seven airliners of its ‘E-Jet’ family and 21 executive jets. The company is the world’s number one manufacturer of commercial jets with up to 150 seats. It is also a major producer of executive jets, as well as military and agricultural aircraft, and additionally is active in other defence and the space sectors. The seven commercial jets delivered comprised six E175 and one E190. The E175 can carry 76 passengers in two classes or 88 seats in maximum density single class, over a range of 4 074 km. The E190 can accommodate 96 passengers in two classes or 114 in maximum density single class, for a distance of 4 537 km. The executive jets were divided into 19 light and two heavy. The light jets were in turn subdivided into three Phenom 100s and 16 Phenom 300s. The Phenom 100 can take two pilots and six passengers (or one pilot and seven passengers), while the Phenom 300 can accommodate two pilots and nine passengers (or one pilot and ten passengers) and is longer-ranged than the smaller version. The two large jets were both Praetor 500s, which can carry a crew of two and up to nine passengers, with international (trans-Atlantic) range. In total, during the first nine months of this year, Embraer delivered 16 commercial jets and 43 executive jets. The commercial jets were eleven E175s, one E190, three E190-E2s and one E195-E2. (The -E2 types are new generation versions of the original E-Jets, with new engines, optimised wings and other refinements; the E190-E2 can carry 97 passengers in three classes or 114 in maximum density single class while the E195-E2 can accommodate 120 passengers in three classes or 146 in maximum density single-class.) The 43 executive jets were subdivided into 33 light jets and ten large ones. The light jets were five Phenom 100s and 28 Phenom 300s, while the large ones were four Praetor 500s, five Praetor 600s and one Legacy 650. As the Legacy family is no longer in production, having been replaced by the Praetor family, this was likely to have been a refurbished second-hand example. Embraer’s current firm order backlog for both commercial and executive jets is worth $15.1-billion. Regarding commercial jets only, in terms of types and numbers there is a firm order backlog of 153 E175s, three E190s, eight E190-E2s and 143 E195-E2s, for a total of 307 airliners. As of the end of September, Embraer had delivered 191 E170s, 645 E175s, 565 E190s, 172 E195s, 14 E190-E2s, and eight E195-E2s. (The smallest -E2 variant, the E175-E2, only made its maiden flight in mid-December last year and has not yet gained any orders.)
