Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS) is implementing an airspace management efficiency initiative, known as the Gauteng Airspace Performance-Based-Navigation Plan (GAPP), to assist in the recovery of the industry post the Covid-19 pandemic. The organisation says it continues to engage with the South African aviation industry through various forums to define and implement airspace efficiency procedures that will enhance operational efficiency while improving safety performance. The main aims and objectives of GAPP are to mitigate the impact of the disaster recovery initiatives on aviation. GAPP is the reviewing, re-designing and enhancement of current procedures within the Gauteng and surrounding airspace with a specific focus on OR Tambo International Airport (known in the aviation space as FAOR) based on global performance-based navigation principles. Among the project goals that ATNS has set are increased safety where separation is achieved by deconflicting routes by design; a more holistic participation in the design phase by the air traffic management community, which includes air traffic controllers and pilots; and an increased capacity during instrument metrological conditions/low-visibility operations. ATNS acting CEO Dumisani Sangweni says the GAPP procedures translate into cost savings, especially focussed towards reducing airline operational costs. “There will be better enhanced predictability for airspace users that will essentially allow for shorter routes to and from OR Tambo International Airport resulting in reduced travel time and increased operational efficiency due to optimal climb and descent profiles. "It means less fuel burn, reduction in emission during take-offs and landings, and reduced noise impacts due to dispersion in an effort to minimise adverse environmental impacts,” he notes.
