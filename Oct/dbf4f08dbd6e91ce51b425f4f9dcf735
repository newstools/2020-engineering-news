Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has asked for an extended timeframe to table the 2020 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). The Speaker of the National Assembly acceded to the request for the Minister to table the budget on October 28, instead of October 21, pending approval of the Parliamentary Programming Committee. Mboweni cited his rationale for the delay asÂ the complex and unusual circumstances brought about by Covid-19, including the tabling of a supplementary budget in June and government's Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan. The Minister and the National Treasury have had to adjust their approaches and budgetary consultation process. During the MTBPS, Mboweni will also table the 2020 Adjustment Estimates of the National Expenditure, second 2020 Adjustments Appropriation Bill, second 2020 Division of Revenue Bill, 2020 Taw Law Amendment Bill, the 2020 Tax Law Administration Bill and the 2020 Rates and Monetary Amounts Bill.
