The Solidarity Fund has appointed Tandi Nzimande to succeed outgoing CEO Nomkhita Nqweni. Nzimande is a chartered accountant, who started her post articles career as a corporate finance adviser at Deutsche Bank. Following that, she acquired and ran a small business in the postal and courier industry for four years. During that period, she also worked for WDB Investment Holdings (WDBIH), a women’s empowerment company where she eventually spent 14 years. She was most recently at Chapter One Innovation Brokerage, a business model research and development firm. Nzimande joined the Hollard Foundation Trust as trustee in 2013 and started working more closely with its Early Childhood Development programme, KYB Change Management and KYB Incubator, as well as its youth employment accelerator programme, Harambee. She is a board member of FirstRand, a trustee of the FirstRand Empowerment Foundation and a fellow of the Africa Leadership Initiative. Nqweni will step down at the end of this week. The fund thanks her for her hard work, passion and steady leadership during a challenging time for all of South Africa. "For the seven months of her pro bono tenure, Nomkhita has worked tirelessly to establish and maintain a credible and transparent structure that would enable the fund to respond rapidly and responsibly to South Africa’s needs during the Covid-19 pandemic," the fund states.
