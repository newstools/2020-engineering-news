Operator of the Gautrain, the Bombela Operating Company (BOC), says it will implement a contingency plan to ensure it is able to still deliver a train service to its passengers after trade union, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) announced that its members would embark on a strike from October 5. "Additional security measures have been implemented on the Gautrain system and the safety of our passengers will not be compromised," the BOC assures passengers. During the morning and afternoon peak periods, trains will be available every 30 minutes on both the North-South and East-West lines. The morning peak period is between 05:30 and 09:00 and the afternoon peak period is between 15:00 and 19:00. "To ensure sufficient capacity is available, all trains operating in the peak periods will be eight-car trains. Services during the off peak will be confirmed early on Monday morning,” the BOC says. It notes that the bus and midi-bus service will not be affected by the strike and will operate as per the standard schedule. Wage negotiations between Numsa and BOC have deadlocked, with the BOC offering  a 4.1% increase in salaries and benefits. Numsa is seeking higher increases.
