Gautrain and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) have signed a wage proposal made by the Bombela Operating Company (BOC), who manages the Gautrain, effectively ending the strike that started on October 5. The standard Gautrain train service will resume on October 16, while trains will continue to operate at 15-minute intervals in peak periods and 30-minute intervals in off-peak periods from October 15. All stations will remain open. Numsa and the BOC, with the support of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, found a way in which BOC’s offer can be supported. Included in the agreement is that lower-income earners, earning up to and including R8 500 a month, will receive a R900 a month increase; while employees earning between R8 501 and R20 000 a month will receive an increase of R850 a month; and all employees who earn more than R20 000 a month will receive a 4.1% increase. The increase will be backdated to July 1.
