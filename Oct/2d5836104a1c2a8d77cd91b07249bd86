South African private sector airline Airlink has resumed scheduled air services between Johannesburg and the Zambian cities of Lusaka and Ndola. This marks the aerial reconnection of the two countries, following lockdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The flights between Johannesburg and the Zambian capital of Lusaka operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, in both directions. The flights between Johannesburg and Ndola, the centre for the Zambian mining industry (and the capital of Copperbelt province), operate on Wednesdays and Fridays, again both ways. “Airlink is delighted to have re-established these vital air services that sustain the all-important trade, business, tourism and family ties between two intrinsically connected markets,” stated Airlink CEO Rodger Foster. The Zambian routes are operated with the company’s modern Embraer E-jet airliners (Airlink has both the Embraer E170 and E190 in its fleet). In economy class, the airline provides a 20 kg free check-in baggage allowance, with an additional 15 kg allowance for sporting equipment. In business class on the E-jets the baggage allowance is 30 kg. Airlink stresses its commitment to passenger and personnel health and safety. Its aircraft cabins are fitted with High Efficiency Particulate Air Filters, which block 99.97% of airborne particulates, including Covid-19 molecules. All Airlink flights are now operated under the company’s own 4Z- flight code. Thus the Johannesburg to Lusaka flights are coded 4Z162 while the Lusaka-Johannesburg flights are coded 4Z163. The Johannesburg-Ndola flights are 4Z152 and the return flights are 4Z153.
