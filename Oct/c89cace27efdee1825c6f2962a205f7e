The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has called on Gauteng residents to continue saving water, despite some small dams in the province being in a stable state, according to this week’s ‘State of Reservoirs’ report published by the department. The provincial water storage is currently at 94.3%, down from last week’s 96.5%. However, the provincial water storage is in a better state compared with the level of 85.6% during the same period last year, the department notes. While some dams are above 100%, some are at lower levels, especially when compared to the corresponding period last year. Currently, the Bon Accord dam is overflowing at 109.6%, the same as last year during this period. Rietvlei dam on the borders of Pretoria has almost reached its capacity at 99.8%, The dam stood at 93.9% last year. Roodeplaat dam, north of the capital city, remained above the 100% mark, at 100.9%. Bronkhorstspruit dam dropped to 86.7% this week from 92.2% last week. “As we are moving towards a hot summer, the DWS is calling on everyone to save water for a brighter future,” it says.
