The Eastern Cape-based Coega Development Corporation (CDC) – which operates the 9 003 ha Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ) – has extended its market offering beyond South Africa's borders into Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) under the Coega Africa Programme (CAP). In Zimbabwe, the CDC is providing consulting services to develop the Norton (Lentsloane) and Eco-soft SEZs in Harare, privately owned by TD Holdings. The sod turning for the SEZs is planned for November. CDC says the focus is on advisory services for a water treatment plant (WTP) in Harare with an estimated investment value of more than $15-million; and an SEZ and dry port (DP) in Norton-Harare with an estimated investment value of $336-million. The CAP further obtained a 20-year concession of logistics bases in Douala in the CAR for the development of a dry port for the storage of goods, with the $30-million project set to start in April next year. These developments, the CDC says, are positive for South Africa, given the recent establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area. The CDC is also awaiting confirmation of projects in Cameroon and the DRC. “Our market development programme to the rest of the African continent is aligned to [South Africa’s] President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call to promote the development and economic integration of the African continent,” says CDC marketing, brand and communication head Dr Ayanda Vilakazi.
