Having received inadequate rainfall over the last few years, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) in the Western Cape is “elated with the much-needed rain” that fell in the Garden Route and surrounding areas recently. The previously low rainfall had affected the Central Karoo, Little Karoo and Garden Route, resulting in the region being hit by a severe drought. The recent rains have resulted in a slight increase for the Gouritz river catchments, with this system currently being at 26.13% capacity, as compared to 24.06% the week prior.

DWS spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says the recent rainfall in the region is an encouraging sign as the region receives its majority rainfall in the summertime.

The main storage dams of the Western Cape water supply system (WCWSS) are the Theewaterskloof, Voëlvlei and Berg river dams (owned and operated by the DWS). These are complemented by the Wemmershoek and the upper and lower Steenbras dams (owned and operated by the City of Cape Town). The combined level of the WCWSS is at 100.39% as compared to 80.22% at the same time in 2019. Meanwhile, the DWS, together with stakeholders, will observe Global Handwashing Day on October 15 – a yearly global advocacy day dedicated to increasing awareness and understanding about the importance of handwashing with soap as an effective and affordable way to prevent diseases.

“The Global Handwashing Day comes at a time when South Africa and the rest of the globe is faced with the Covid-19 pandemic. Communities are urged to wash hands with soap and water to curb the spread of the virus” he says.
