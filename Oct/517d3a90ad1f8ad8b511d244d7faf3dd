The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has reopened the upgraded bridge on Spring road, in Weltevreden Park, to motorists and pedestrians. The bridge had been closed off to vehicle and pedestrian traffic since March 2017 after it was washed away by floods. Its initial design capacity was not adequate to carry the latest water capacity of the river and, therefore, had to be redesigned and refurbished. “The current design is based on latest hydrological analysis. The project scope entailed the demolition of the existing bridge that had failed, and the construction of a new bridge. Included as part of the bridge works is the construction of link road, associated storm water and upgrading of pedestrian walkways leading to the bridge,” JRA infrastructure and development head Siyabonga Genu says. A budget of R53.9-million was allocated for the project. The project also created 28 short-term job opportunities and about R1.5-million was spent on local wages.
