Air Seychelles announced on Thursday that it was instituting summer season flights from Johannesburg to the Maldives. These would be operated via a short stop in the Seychelles themselves. The flights would run from December 2 this year to January 9 next year. The flights from Johannesburg to the Maldives would be operated on Fridays, while the return flights would be on Saturdays. Total flight time (one way) would be less than nine hours. This schedule would allow holidaymakers to have a full week’s vacation in the Maldives. Further, passengers on the return flight could also opt for a stopover in the Seychelles. In addition, during December the airline would operate three non-stop flights each week between Johannesburg and the Seychelles. These services would be operated using Air Seychelles Airbus A320neo aircraft, of which it has two. (The rest of its fleet comprises five Viking Air DHC-6 Twin Otter small turboprop passenger aircraft, for domestic operations.) Passengers must observe all health and safety protocols when travelling on Air Seychelles. This included completing the airline’s own health self-assessment form (available online) 24 hours before the flight, and wearing a mask throughout the flight. Furthermore, all passengers must present a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test, done no more than 72 hours before the flight. Those visiting the Seychelles must fill in a mandatory Health Travel Authorisation form (also available online) before arriving in the country. Tourists going to the Maldives should check the Maldives government tourism website for the latest information on that country’s anti-Covid-19 measures. Air Seychelles is the country’s predominantly State-owned national flag carrier, with United Arab Emirates airline Etihad Airways holding a 40% share. Etihad is also a strategic partner for Air Seychelles, which currently operates international flights to Johannesburg, Mauritius, Mumbai (India) and Tel Aviv (Israel).
