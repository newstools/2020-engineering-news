Thamsanqa Hlongwa has resigned as the chief executive of Umgeni Water with immediate effect, the State-owned entity announced on Thursday. In a note to shareholders, South Africa's second largest water board said that Hlongwa's resignation had been accepted. He had been appointed acting group CEO in September 2017, a position made permanent in in July 2018. Umgeni did not give a reason for Hlongwa's abrupt resignation. The board has appointed Nomalungelo Mkhize, the group's current chief financial officer, to the role of acting CEO in the interim while it "deliberates on the initiation of the process to fill the position".
