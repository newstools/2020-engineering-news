Dams levels in the Western Cape continue to rise, with the average level for dams in the province increasing marginally to a new high of 81.2%, which is up from 65.1% at the same time in 2019. The latest level for dams providing water to the City of Cape Town are 100.3%, up from the 80.2% during the same time in 2019. Nonetheless, Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell continues to call on the public to use water as responsibly and as sparingly as possible. “We are heading to the summer season where demand increases and when we may see dam levels starting to drop significantly. We need to continue to work together in managing our entire water system optimally.” Simultaneously, he thanks the public and other water users for the continued efforts over the past six years to drive down consumption. “The drought has seen a great coming together of government, communities and other partners, including nongovernmental organisations. We want to thank each one for their efforts and assistance.” Bredell says the department continues to monitor the situation and provide support, where possible, in the Karoo regions of the province where the drought continues. On a more granular level, the major dams of the Western Cape include the Voëlvlei dam being 98.1% during the second week of October, up from 87.9% in 2019, but slightly down from the 98.7% recorded in the first week of October.
