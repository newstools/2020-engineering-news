The Competition Tribunal on October 14 confirmed a settlement agreement between the Competition Commission and cable manufacturer Aberdare Cables. Under the terms of the settlement, Aberdare has admitted to price fixing, market allocation and collusive tendering in contravention of the Competition Act, between 2001 and 2010, but will not be paying an administrative penalty. The commission started investigating an alleged cable cartel case against Aberdare in March 2010, whereby Aberdare and three other companies were involved in supplying the market with electric cables. The commission found that Aberdare and the three other companies had agreed to fix the price of power cables sold to wholesalers, distributors and original-equipment manufacturers from around May 2001 to at least 2010. It also found that Aberdare and two other companies had agreed, or engaged in a concerted practice, to divide markets by allocating customers in respect of the supply of power cables from around 2001 to at least the end of 2007. The commission further accused Aberdare of collusive tendering for tenders issued by various municipalities, and State-owned power utility Eskom, while also allocating customers in the mining industry. Aberdare applied for corporate leniency in terms of the commissionâ€™s Corporate Leniency Policy and was granted conditional immunity by the commission from prosecution before the tribunal in March 2012. Aberdare endeavoured to develop, implement and monitor a competition law compliance programme incorporating corporate governance designed to ensure that its employees, management, directors and agents do not engage in contraventions of the Competition Act.
