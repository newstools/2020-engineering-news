Water utility Rand Water says its Eikenhof pumping station has not been operating since early on October 21 as a result of an unplanned electricity outage. "Rand Water’s reservoir levels that receive water supply from the Eikenhof pumping station are now at significantly reduced levels. "Johannesburg Water consumers in Hursthill, Roodepoort, Soweto and Florida, as well as consumers in Mogale City, Merafong City, Westonaria and Rustenburg will be affected if the electricity supply is not restored soon," the utility says.
