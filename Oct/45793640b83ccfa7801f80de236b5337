Energy storage solution company BlueNova Energy has undertaken its first international export of an intelligent Energy Storage System (iESS). The iESS is a containerised energy unit, which will be installed at the Timbila Nature Reserve in Namibia, as the heart of an offgrid solar-powered system. BlueNova says the solution is the culmination of years of development in the lithium battery sector. “We are excited to achieve this landmark export and support a growing industry in renewable and offgrid technologies in Africa. Many countries suffer from unstable grid supplies and high electricity costs. “We competed against three of the leading energy companies in the world for this bid – being a local supplier with local support is what won it for us. The local energy storage sector is increasingly cost-effective, innovative and competitive − benefits to the environment and consumers will only increase," says BlueNova CEO James Verster. The Timbila Nature Reserve iESS is fitted with a 250 kW inverter and 1 000 kWh lithium battery, which is the equivalent of powering almost 80 standard homes for more than 12 hours. The export of the unit is a milestone for the company, which will produce further units over the next year to combat load-shedding and increasingly onerous electricity tariffs within South Africa and for the export market.
