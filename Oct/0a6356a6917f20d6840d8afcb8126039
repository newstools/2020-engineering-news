Japanese car maker Nissan has confirmed that it will bring the newly launched Magnite sports-utility vehicle (SUV) to the local market early next year. Pricing will only be announced nearer to the domestic launch, however. The Magnite will compete in the popular small SUV segment (B-SUV segment), which has seen significant growth in recent years, as well as increasing competition as car makers scramble to address the shift from sedans to SUVs. The Nissan Magnite promises a tech pack that includes a wireless charger, air purifier, puddle lamps, ambient mood lighting and JBL speakers powered by Harman. The vehicle offers 60-40 split foldable rear seats, and 336 l luggage capacity. The Magnite is also equipped with an around view monitor (AVM), which provides a driver a virtual bird’s eye view from above the vehicle. Prospective buyers can also look forward to an eight-inch infotainment display with flush touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with built-in voice recognition. Nissan Connect offers more than 50 features, including geofencing, roadside assistance and smartwatch connectivity. The vehicle comes with the HRA0 1.0-litre turbo engine, which is available with manual five-speed and automatic gearbox. It is also equipped with safety features such as antilock braking, electronic brake-force distribution, hydraulic brake assist, vehicle dynamic control, traction control, hill-start assist, speed-sensing door locks, central locking and a dual airbag system. Ground clearance is 205 mm.
