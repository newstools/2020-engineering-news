Industry body the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) has announced the finalists for the sixth edition of its Awards for Excellence. The awards promote and reward innovation and excellence in the metals and engineering sector. Seifsa notes that, as a result of the pandemic, many businesses had to close, but others were better placed to adjust to the new climate by recalibrating their businesses. It says the adaptability and innovation required to adapt are exactly what Seifsa aims to celebrate through these awards. While this year’s entries were related to activities that took place before the pandemic started, Seifsa says the entrants demonstrated a commitment to excellence that will be required to drive economic recovery post the pandemic. The finalists for most innovative company are Hencon Conveyers, Alos Holdings, Boikano Industries, Elgin Brown and Hammer, Mann Makhene Machinery, Centurion Systems, Sinter Metals and Matsway Steel. The finalists for Health and Safety Award of the Year are Babcock and Kaefer. The Best Corporate Social Responsibility Programme of the Year winner is Beka Schréder.
