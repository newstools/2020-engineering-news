Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines recently launched their fortieth humanitarian delivery flight, when the airline’s new 787 Dreamliner departed Everett, Washington carrying more than 20 000 pounds of humanitarian supplies. The shipment, including supplies for healthcare and family needs, will be distributed to hospitals, clinics and charities in the Addis Ababa region. “Ethiopian Airlines has been deeply involved in transporting critical Covid-19 supplies to support communities during these difficult and challenging times. "Building on our history of collaboration in humanitarian flights, we are partnering with Boeing to bring home healthcare supplies. We would like to thank the Ethiopian community and several organisations in Seattle for their generosity and support for Ethiopian communities across the world during the global pandemic,” said Ethiopian Airlines ET holidays & digital sales VP Kagnew Asfaw. Humanitarian supplies on the flight were provided by three charitable partners in Seattle − Resolute Health Outreach, the Ethiopian National Covid-19 Response Task Force of Seattle and Embuaa Family. They contributed supplies ranging from face masks, wipes and sterile gloves to exam tables, bassinets, medicine and more. The Ethiopian National Covid-19 Response Task Force is led by Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, in partnership with Ethiopian embassies and diaspora communities around the world. Some of the medical supplies, clothing and hygiene products will be provided to the Mary Joy Foundation, which helps women and youth access skills and training to rise out of poverty. The Humanitarian Delivery Flight Program was launched in 1992 as a collaboration between Boeing and its customers to transport humanitarian supplies assistance around the world on newly delivered airplanes with otherwise empty cargo holds.
