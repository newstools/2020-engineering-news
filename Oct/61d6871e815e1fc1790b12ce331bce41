The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has apologised to road users for the inconvenience caused owing to the flooding that occurred on the M1 double decker section on October 5. The agency says it is investigating the causes of the flooding and adds that its operations team will ramp up planned and reactive maintenance of the stormwater infrastructure. The JRA has also taken the decision to immediately place the JRA head of department of regional operations on precautionary suspension pending further investigations on matters related to the maintenance of the M1 double decker section and other parts of its roads network. The JRA is also requesting road users and community members to report to the JRA if they suspect that their stormwater drains are full and blocked. It also urges people to refrain from dumping garbage inside stormwater drains as this causes flooding, especially during the rainy season.
