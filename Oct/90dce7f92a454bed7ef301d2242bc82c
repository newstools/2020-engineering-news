The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) will start seeking competent contractors over the next few weeks to assist in resolving the protracted sewage pollution of the Vaal river. The department, after finalising the scope of what is required to solve the longstanding sewage pollution challenge, will advertise 26 work packages, with the appointed contractors on the ground during the December festive season. “In the current 2020/21 financial year, the DWS committed R911-million towards solving the sewer spillage challenge. A total investment by the department in the 2020/21 financial year is R1.2-billion for work that includes the building of additional wastewater treatment capacity and associated pump stations,” the DWS said in a statement. “Provided there are no community protests leading to work stoppages, and these have become more frequent in recent times, the department plans to launch the Module 6 in the Sebokeng water care works before the end of the current financial year,” it said. The DWS assured that is taking all the necessary precautions to ensure that it complies with the provisions of Section 217 of the Constitution in terms of procurement, with checks and balances followed to the letter to ensure compliance with procurement processes. “This thoroughness on the part of the department caused delays, but was necessary to ensure processes were done in a completely honest and straightforward manner.” The process of advertising for competent contractors is at its final stages and adverts will be in the Government Gazette soon. The start and completion dates of the project will be communicated once the contractors have been appointed.
