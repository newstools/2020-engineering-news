President Cyril Ramaphosa will be performing his duties from home after a guest at a fundraising dinner he attended tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19). According to The Presidency, Ramaphosa is not displaying symptoms. Ramaphosa attended the Adopt-a-School-Foundation’s dinner on Saturday, with 35 guests, one of whom had shown Covid-19 symptoms on Sunday, tested on Monday and received a positive result on Tuesday. “The Foundation became aware of this development and communicated this to guests yesterday, hours after the President had performed the unveiling of a statue of liberation icon Oliver Reginald Tambo and the official opening of a new Radisson hotel and convention centre in Ekurhuleni in the morning,” the Presidency said. Ramaphosa is regularly screened by the South African Military Health Service at all his public engagements and will be tested should Covid-19 symptoms develop.
