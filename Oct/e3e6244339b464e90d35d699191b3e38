Coal miner Exxaro’s new head office building, in Centurion, Gauteng, developed and owned by property developer Growthpoint, has achieved a 6-Star green rating from the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) under the Green Star New Build certification system. Green building certification integrates a spectrum of green initiatives and a 6-Star As-Built rating confirms that these initiatives have been implemented at a global leadership level. The 18 500 m2 building was conceptualised in a collaboration between Growthpoint’s Trading and Development team and Exxaro. Exxaro’s head office is the second development in Growthpoint’s portfolio to achieve a 6-Star As-Built rating. Earlier this year, One Discovery Place earned the same certification, outperforming its original 5-Star Design rating by achieving greater reductions in carbon emissions. “To retain Growthpoint’s status as a green building leader among South African real estate investment trusts, we believe it is important to progress our strategy by exploring new opportunities. "We have intensified our focus on renewable energy with clean solar power, continuing our journey towards the goal of zero waste to landfill and developing, testing and, in due course, implementing a carbon-neutral strategy,” comments Growthpoint sustainability and utilities head Grahame Cruickshanks. Exxaro’s green certified head office provides it with enhanced resource efficiency in an optimal working environment, with indoor environmental quality being among the categories covered in Green Star certification, noted Growthpoint. Local and global studies show that better indoor air quality, lighting and acoustics lead to an improvement in people’s health, wellbeing and cognitive performance.
