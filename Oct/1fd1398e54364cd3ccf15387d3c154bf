Nonprofit green economy organisation GreenCape has launched an open source Green Business Support Services Directory. This interactive digital directory, which was developed in partnership with the Friedrich Neumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF), is a public resource with information on services, programmes and opportunities available to entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises in the green economy. The collaboration between the two organisations seek to support the growth of the green economy by linking innovators and entrepreneurs to the kind of support they require to accelerate their green and market-driven products and solutions, says FNF South Africa research projects head Cecelia Kok. The directory serves two primary target markets; firstly, it is a platform for business development services, such as consultants, trainers and financiers to publicise support services, programmes and opportunities available for South African green business entrepreneurs. The directory is also a resource that green business entrepreneurs can use to access sector-relevant support services that can assist in leveraging opportunities for business growth and cross-cutting entry into commercial, industrial, residential and municipal markets. Businesses that would like to list their support services can do so for free at https://greendirectory.co.za/register/.
