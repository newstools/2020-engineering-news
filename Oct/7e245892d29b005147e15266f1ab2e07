The Imperial Wanderers Stadium, in Sandton, is one of the first stadiums in South Africa to "go green" through a partnership with Imperial and the SolarSaver Group to bring solar power to the multipurpose entertainment and lifestyle venue through the installation of a customised 250 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The installation at the stadium will reduce grid reliance and power the 28 000-person capacity venue. “This is a huge step towards reducing the stadium’s carbon footprint,” says stadium manager Cyril Martin. She notes that the stadium now has three sources of power − grid, generator and solar energy − to run the stadium, especially on big international match days and for non-cricket events. The solar installation was completed by the SolarSaver Group, which was founded with a view to offering clients a unique solar solution that does not require any capital or financial guarantees. “The SolarSaver Group portfolio includes over 200 systems operated under long-term power purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts across South Africa and Namibia," says SolarSaver in a statement issued on October 6. It adds that the installation at Imperial Wanderers Stadium forms part of the stadium’s aesthetic, with the solar panels situated in and around the stadium. “The partnership forms part of the stadium’s long-term strategic intent to ‘go green’,” says Central Gauteng Lions CEO Jono Leaf-Wright, adding that this “means helping to protect the environment and sustain its natural resources for current and future generations”. As part of measures to reduce its impact on the environment, the stadium's drainage infrastructure collects all water, including rainwater, in a reservoir to ensure water is saved and re-used. The stadium seldom uses municipal water, if at all, and borehole water is always used for the grounds.
