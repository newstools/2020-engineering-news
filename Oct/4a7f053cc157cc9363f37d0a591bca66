Further to President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s directive to organs of State in August to submit information around their Covid-19 procurement, the National Treasury has published an interactive Covid-19 procurement dashboard to show procurement activity. Treasury was tasked with creating a standard predefined format that organs of State can use to share information with members of the public. The dashboard provides information around the actual products bought, the quantities acquired and the price per item. The data can be filtered for every supplier to show quantities and order amounts bought from them, across all organs of State that reported. Treasury has designed the dashboard to also list the names of directors of companies that have provided Covid-19-related goods, services or works. The data will be regularly updated as and when organs of State provide reports on their procurement spend, which they have been mandated to do on a monthly basis.
