Professional body the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) and statutory body the South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to work together on a number of fronts with the view to supporting development and growth within the built environment. “The SACPCMP has long-sought to foster relationships with organisations both locally and internationally for the benefit of the construction Industry. The finalisation of this MoU with the CIOB will facilitate the activities undertaken by both entities to promote transformation and development within the sector,” says SACPCMP registrar Butcher Matutle. The MoU will result in the CIOB and SACPCMP collaborating, where possible, in the best interests of the construction industry in South Africa, as well as working together to raise standards among construction professionals and promoting continuous professional development. These aims allow for the CIOB’s public benefit mission to have greater impact and provide more support for SACPCMP-registered persons and CIOB members in South Africa.
