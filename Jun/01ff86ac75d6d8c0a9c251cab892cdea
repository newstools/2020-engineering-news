The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has invited eligible small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs) in South Africa to apply for funding to manufacture fabric face masks. This initiative by the UNDP, in partnership with the South African Local Government Association, aims to provide relief for SMMEs that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19 and is open to both formal and informal traders operating in the Gauteng and Northern Cape provinces. Businesses that have been approved for or are recipients of Covid-19 relief support will not be eligible. Eligibility criteria and application details are available on www.za.undp.org. Applications will close on June 23. The UNDP says successful applicants will receive financial support to help recover from the impacts of Covid-19 and are required to produce fabric face masks using these funds, which will help strengthen South Africaâ€™s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
