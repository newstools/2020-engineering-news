Russian potash mining company Uralkali has joined the Action Africa: Thriving Farms, Thriving Future initiative that is funded by Norwegian fertiliser producer Yara. The initiative is backed by the United Nations World Food Programme and is supported by a number of African industry associations and organisations. The initiative intends to provide agricultural producers in Africa with mineral fertilisers and relevant digital solutions, as well as to offer information and agrochemical support to ensure food security amid the global economic crisis in the wake of Covid-19. Uralkali says it wants to make a contribution towards improving the efficiency of farms in African countries, while ensuring that demand for its products is met to the maximum potential. The company says that, through its contribution to the initiative, it wants to help increase farmers’ yield and strengthen the health of the African population through better nutrition – this also provides the company market access to the most vulnerable population groups in Africa. Uralkali CEO Dmitry Osipov notes that food security in Africa is one of the most pressing and urgent issues, especially considering the current pandemic. “We fully support the initiative and join our colleagues at Yara in providing comprehensive support to farmers in Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Tanzania.”
