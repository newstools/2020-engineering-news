ASX- and Aim-listed Tlou Energy has been granted a 15-year electricity generation licence by the Botswana Energy Regulatory Authority. The licence is for 2 MW of coalbed methane, gas and solar power generation at the company’s Lesedi project. The power will be sold to the Botswana Power Corporation. This first hybrid power generation plant will mark the start of an initial scalable power project, which will, following successful completion, be scaled to generate additional electricity for Botswana and neighbouring countries. Tlou is focused on delivering power solutions to Botswana and the rest of Southern Africa to alleviate some of the chronic power shortages in the region. Tlou’s Lesedi and Mamba projects involve gas mining, which started in 2014, over ten prospecting licences. The company’s project acreage covers a vast area spanning about 9 300 km2.
