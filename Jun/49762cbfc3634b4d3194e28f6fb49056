The Fleeker platform, created by four University of Cape Town (UCT) students, allows users to schedule appointments with hairstylists, barbers, make-up artists and nail technicians and manage long in-salon queues to meet physical distancing regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Physical distancing, limited customer numbers and strict hygiene protocols mean trips to the barbershop, hair salon or beauty spa will look a lot different now as the industry reopens under lockdown “advanced” Level 3, says Fleeker co-founder and UCT economics and finance student Asonele Gevenga. Fleeker requires stylists to register online by completing a simple registration form. While there is no upfront cost involved, 10% of every successful booking goes to Fleeker. Once stylists have signed up, the platform’s location-sharing functionality ensures that potential clients can select a salon near them. Fleeker currently lists a range of local businesses and more than 100 UCT students make use of its service. Gevenga says a growing number of non-UCT students also make use of the platform. Since March, the team has been hard at work coming up with creative ways to ensure stylists and beauty therapists will still generate an income once lockdown restrictions were eased and the sector reopened, he says. The system’s improvements benefit stylists and their clients alike, he states, pointing out that there is an option for stylists to go to a client's home, eliminating the risks of a crowded salon. Further, Fleeker also offers a cashless payment system. A built-in feature also enables stylists to track their monthly income, making financial planning a lot easier. “We’ve received great feedback from our clients, as well their clients, especially during this time. This has reinforced our commitment to ensure all stylists, big and small, have a fighting chance in the market and are able to connect with customers in an efficient way,” Gevenga says.
