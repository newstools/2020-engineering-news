Information and communication technology (ICT) giant Huawei has launched a new intelligent productivity and collaboration tool to drive enterprise collaboration in sub-Saharan Africa. Huawei IdeaHub will enable an all-scenario smart office, with an intelligent endpoint integrating multiple functions including multi-screen collaboration between mobiles and computers, interactive whiteboard, remote collaboration, full high-definition (HD) video conferencing and built-in HD AppGallery. The product also offers a virtual exhibition of products and services. “Improving communication and collaboration in organisations is going to be the new normal, and a new generation of intelligent office collaboration products is needed to accelerate this revolution,” says Huawei Enterprise Business Group Southern Africa president Liao Yong. Huawei IdeaHub can be both disruptive and constructive for African firms, he adds. “It is disruptive since it can break down silos and enable employees to share ideas like never before. It is commercially, and even culturally, constructive as it could help companies build up an intelligent work environment where ideas and information can flow more freely for enhanced efficiency and lower operation costs.” Huawei also launched its “1+3+X” all-scenario smart office strategy, with multiple smart office equipment and supporting software ecosystem, to further explore the needs of enterprise users and provide them with an advanced productivity tool. He believes that the tool also provides firms the opportunity to restructure work processes and digitise work culture, subsequently driving their organisational digitisation.
