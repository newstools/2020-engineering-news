With the aim of celebrating and encouraging women in the construction industry, public entity, the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB), has developed an awards programme to showcase women-led projects and achievements. The Empowerment and Recognition of Women in Construction (Erwic) Awards consists of ten awards categories, which are open for entry to any entity which is registered with the CIDB and is at least 51% female-owned. The awards also recognise clients, entities and individuals who support gender transformation and mentorship of women within the industry. Entries will open on June 15 and close on July 17, with winners to be announced during Women’s Month in August. Traditionally a male-dominated industry, the construction industry has seen a great evolution over the past few years. Today, women are increasingly assuming positions once considered ‘male’ roles, overcoming outdated stereotypes, the organisation notes. It highlights that enterprise development and empowerment of this emerging sector is core to its strategy for growth and development of the construction industry. The CIDB has identified women as a critical target for development and has chosen to celebrate and encourage this group through the Erwic Awards process. The aim of the awards is to encourage excellence among women and commitment among stakeholders to support women in their professional growth and development. Through the Erwic Awards, the CIDB also aims to promote role models for women in lower-grade construction categories, and motivate women in the higher grades. Entered projects must have been completed in the Southern African regions between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, to be eligible for the 2020 Awards. Additionally, the project must have been completed on time and to client satisfaction.
