Agricultural industry body Grain SA has had to make changes to its plans for this year's Nampo Harvest Day, which has been bringing the agriculture sector together for almost six decades. The 2020 Nampo Harvest Day show, which will be the fifty-fourth edition of this agricultural trade show, will now be held online. This year’s show is themed “Find your 2020 Agri-vision”. From September 9 to 12, the virtual Nampo trade show will connect farmers, suppliers and colleagues with many exhibitors and online content from across the industry and the globe. Grain SA will convert the trade show into a convenient and safe interactive online virtual experience, it says. “During a pandemic which is expected to peak in September, we cannot responsibly go ahead with a show that attracts more than 20 000 visitors a day," says Grain SA CEO Jannie de Villiers. Nampo Harvest Day will revamp its digital presence with a virtual event that will feature most of what attendees would have experienced at the physical Harvest Day. In addition, the platform variation has provided Grain SA with the opportunity to continue with a virtual Nampo Harvest Day experience beyond this year. Grain SA says that while the virtual offering will never be able to replace the face-to-face experience of visitors and exhibitors on Nampo Park, it will provide future exhibitors with the option to complement their physical presence at Nampo with a virtual duplicate of their booth, reaching an even wider audience in 2021 and beyond.
