Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe has welcomed the recent appointments of a number of women to senior executive positions in the energy sector. According to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE), the appointment of women to leadership roles, specifically in the energy sector, and also broadly in society, bodes well to sustain development and transformation. It was recently announced that BP Southern Africa had appointed Taelo Mojapelo CEO, Sasol had appointed Priscilla Mabelane energy business lead, the Strategic Fuel Fund Nelisiwe Magubane chairperson, the African Exploration Mining Finance Corporation Zanele Sibisi COO and the Petroleum Agency of South Africa Dr Phindile Masangane CEO. "The DMRE wishes these appointees great success and encourages them to collaborate, where necessary, and in their individual companies, to engender a commitment to economic growth and development. "The department also entrusts them to use their knowledge of the energy sector and expertise and confidence in the authority that accompanies their new leadership roles to ensure greater transformation," the department says.
