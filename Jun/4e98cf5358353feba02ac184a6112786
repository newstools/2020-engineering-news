JSE-listed real estate investment trust Redefine Properties will, along with equity partners Madison International Realty and Griffin Real Estate in European Logistics Investment, and in joint venture with its strategic development partner Panattoni Europe, start building a 50 000 m2 build-to-suit (BTS) manufacturing and warehouse facility for Weber-Stephen Products in Zabrze, within the Upper Silesian metropolitan area, in Poland. The building will include more than 5 000 m2 of office space. The site is also provisioned for an additional 30 000 m2 of office space if Weber’s growth exceeds expectations. Weber is a privately held US manufacturer of charcoal, gas and electric outdoor grills and related accessories. The project will be Weber’s first manufacturing facility in Europe and, when complete, will have space for about 450 employees. The construction will begin in August and the building will be ready for occupation during the second half of 2021. The BTS facility will serve as Weber’s primary distribution operation for Europe, Asia and Africa. "The coronavirus pandemic is expected to intensify the demand for warehousing as supply chains are restructured and to meet the growth in online spending. The growth in e-commerce is benefitting logistics, especially the development of 'last mile' delivery facilities," says Redefine CEO Andrew Konig. “Our strategy in Poland is centred around creating a leading logistics platform and Zabrze located in Upper Silesia, one of the most attractive logistics locations in the country, was a natural choice for Weber,” says Redefine Europe CEO Pieter Prinsloo. The logistics real estate sector is proving to be more resilient than other real estate classes during Covid-19, says Redefine.
