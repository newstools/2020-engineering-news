Dual-listed property firm EPP says it is successfully concluding remaining tenant agreements. The company, which is the largest owner of retail real estate in Poland, further notes in a pre-close statement that it is laying the foundations to better position the company in a post Covid-19 environment. It is also conducting analysis and recommendations on asset purchases and sales. EPP is also pursuing further cost optimisation. The company’s longer-term strategy is under preparation, that of a three- to five-year plan, with a focus on capital structure, existing asset base and growth of the company in post-Covid-19 times. In terms of the company’s retail portfolio, operations are nearing normality, it notes. In June, the company had 96% occupancy and 70% of pre-pandemic footfall levels. The company noted that in terms of its liquidity position, it is well capitalised, with cash on hand of €170-million. Liquidity is secured with the retention of a €53-million dividend and €95-million in corporate facilities. The company’s 2020 full-year earnings per share guidance is expected to be between €0.04 and €0.05 apiece. This is based on assumptions that the Polish economy continues its recovery in the second half of the year; that there are no significant tenant failures; the successful conclusion of remaining tenant discussions; and no second wave of Covid-19 in the second half of the year, which would have a detrimental impact on shopping centres.
