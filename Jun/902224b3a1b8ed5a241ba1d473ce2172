Rand Water on June 3 welcomed support from the South African Local Government Association for its proposed 2020/21 tariff increase. Rand Water aims to introduce a tariff increase of 6.6%, from R10.09/kl to R10.76/kl. “In determining the proposed increase, Rand Water undertook a rigorous and comprehensive consultation process with all our customers and stakeholders,” it said in a statement. “Our calculations are formulated after due consideration to the costs of abstracting, purifying and distributing bulk potable water to local municipalities.” The increase is also necessary to ensure that all the requisite infrastructure is installed and upgraded when necessary, thereby allowing Rand Water to retain our record of an uninterrupted supply of bulk potable water.
