The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has delivered 2 211 water tanks across Gauteng. Since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak in South Africa, the department has been deploying water tanks to communities in densely-populated areas across Gauteng. The areas include the cities of Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni, and the district municipalities of Sedibeng and West Rand. “As part of the frontline departments that seek to ease the impact of the coronavirus, DWS is geared to continue efforts to a more effective contribution to mount the fight against the spread of the virus,” DWS Gauteng provincial head Sibusiso Mthembu said in a statement. “The DWS is progressively making an impact to water challenges in overcrowded environments, as communities are now receiving water to practice hygiene to wash hands to prevent the spread of the deadly virus,” he explained. The department’s efforts are now reaching every corner of Gauteng where water is needed.
