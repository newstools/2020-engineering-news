To ensure efficient and effective case referral and application processes, which are also safe during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has introduced a free digital platform for CCMA users to refer conciliation and arbitration disputes and submit enforcement and/or condonation applications. The platform has been available since June 8, and is accessible via the CCMA website, its Facebook page and at https://cmsonline.ccma.org.za. The digital referral and application platform is hosted by the CCMA and is subject to strict online security provisions, where the CCMA has put in place maximum information security measures, which it endeavours to continue keeping in place. “The digital referral and application platform forms part of a broader long-term plan as envisaged in the new organisational strategy Imvuselelo – The Revival, the CCMA’s 2020/21 to 2024/25 five-year strategy, to strengthen the information and communication technology infrastructure to enhance service delivery,” says CCMA director Cameron Morajane. He adds that, by providing users with a means of referral that does not involve physical travel to CCMA offices, the digital referral and application platform aims to contribute to the minimisation of the further spread of the Covid-19 virus, improve efficiency and relieve users of unnecessary travel and further administrative costs.
