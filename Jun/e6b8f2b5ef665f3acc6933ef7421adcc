Global petrochemicals company Total has joined the Getting to Zero Coalition to support the maritime industry’s decarbonisation agenda. Total will be collaborating with companies across the maritime, energy, infrastructure and finance sectors to help achieve the target set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The IMO wants to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050, compared with 2008 levels. To achieve this, the coalition members plan to bring commercially viable deep-sea zero-emission vessels – powered by zero-emission fuels – into operation by 2030. For Total, joining the coalition marks a step in its commitment to a cleaner maritime sector. Total will contribute to the coalition’s focus areas including fuels, marine lubricants and zero-emission technologies for ships. The joining of the coalition follows shortly after Total declared its ambition to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, by developing cleaner fuels for the maritime industry. “By joining the Getting to Zero Coalition, we want to push innovation and foster collective actions with all the stakeholders of the industry, thus contributing more efficiently to the reduction of the carbon footprint of maritime transport and its energy value chains,” says Total president and CEO Patrick Pouyanné. Total is already actively working on improving the environmental footprint of the shipping industry, through the development of marine liquid natural gas supply infrastructure, fuel-efficient lubricants, biofuels and batteries. The Getting to Zero Coalition was launched at the United Nations climate summit, in September 2019, as a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum, the Friends of the Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum. It comprises more than 120 public and private organisations.
