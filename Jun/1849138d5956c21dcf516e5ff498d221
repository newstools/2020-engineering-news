The Competition Tribunal says a wholesaler based in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, Samys Wholesalers, has admitted to charging excessive prices for 50 mℓ and 200 mℓ bottles of hand sanitisers in March. The admission forms part of a consent agreement between the wholesaler and the Competition Commission. In terms of the consent agreement, which has been confirmed as an order of the tribunal, Samys has agreed to, besides others, immediately desist from the excessive pricing conduct;  immediately reduce its mark-up on 50 mℓ and 200 mℓ hand sanitisers to agreed maximum percentages for the duration of the State of National Disaster; and donate hand sanitisers valued at R4 000 to four identified nonprofit organisations in the Kimberley area.
