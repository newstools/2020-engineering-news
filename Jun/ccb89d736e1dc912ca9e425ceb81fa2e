As the events surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic continue to evolve, the philanthropic arm of NYSE-listed Caterpillar, the Caterpillar Foundation, is committing over R1-million to the South African Solidarity Fund to assist the country in its response to the unprecedented health crisis. The fund aims to detect and prevent, and to support measures to flatten the curve by lowering infection rates, provide essential support and supplies to medical staff and patients, such as protective equipment and ventilators; and support those whose lives are disrupted by Covid-19 through access to food, financial resources and educational materials. "We are proud to partner with King Baudouin Foundation US to support efforts to prevent, detect and respond to the pandemic in South Africa, including regions where we operate," said Caterpillar district manager for the Southern Africa region Dave Carius. The Caterpillar Foundation is focused on building more sustainable and resilient communities, “helping them emerge stronger together during this crisis". In total, including support for the South African Solidarity Fund, the Caterpillar Foundation has committed $10-million to directly support global Covid-19 response activities and help organisations that have been impacted, providing healthcare resources; addressing food insecurity; and enabling online education for youth. Support was also given to global organisations and funds, including the United Nations Foundation, the World Health Organization Solidarity Response Fund, the Global Foodbanking Network, and locally to many communities around the world where Caterpillar employees live and work.
