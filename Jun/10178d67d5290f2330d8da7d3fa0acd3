The national roll-out date for the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) Act has been delayed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. In August 2019, the Aarto Bill was signed into law and, although no date was officially promulgated, it was intended to take effect by mid-2020. The capacity of the Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA), which is the entity responsible for the roll-out of Aarto, has been severely compromised owing to the pandemic, and the entity has suffered a significant loss of income. For this reason, the RTIA is not in a position to, at this stage, fully conduct the national roll-out and the situation will be reviewed in due course for further determination as to when the roll-out date can be promulgated.
