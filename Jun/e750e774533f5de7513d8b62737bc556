The Solidarity Fund has, to date, approved about R1.4-billion to fund initiatives to prevent, support, detect and care for those affected by Covid-19 in South Africa. Of this amount, 75% has been allocated towards the health-related aspects, including Covid-19 testing kits and ventilators, while 20% has been allocated to humanitarian efforts, including food relief and support for survivors of gender-based violence. The balance, or R36-million, has been allocated towards general education and awareness campaigns to help curb the spread of Covid-19. On the health side, more than 35-million pieces of personal protective equipment have been procured, while 200 intensive care unit ventilators have been funded, for delivery towards the end of July. The fund will use R11.3-million to support the development of locally-made non-invasive-type ventilators. The Solidarity Fund proceeds have also helped to increase the country’s testing capacity, especially in under-served areas. Moreover, the fund has provided food relief to 280 000 families to date and will reach an additional 23 500 households through a food voucher initiative. The support for victims of gender-based violence has amounted to R17-million so far. As at June 18, the fund has received R2.9-billion in pledges, with more than R2.6-billion being deposited. This includes more than 265 000 donations from 1 800 corporates and trusts, and nearly 264 000 individual donations.
