The dams within the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) continue to decline, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) said in a statement on June 3. The average water levels in the system declined from 67.3% last week to 66.6% this week, while at the same time last year, it hovered at 73.7%. The Vaal dam, plunging to a low of 48.9% this week from 49.8%, recorded its biggest drop in average water levels since this time last year. Last year during this week, the dam was at 70.8%. Similar drops took place in the other dams that are part of the IVRS, including the Grootdraai and Bloemhof dams. “The Grootdraai dam fell from 87.8% last week to 86.7% presently. However, the dam is in a much safer position compared with the lower levels of 74.2% it saw last year in the same week,” the DWS said. The Bloemhof dam contracted from 100.6% last week – and 104% this time last year – to 99.1% this week. “The Mohale and Katse dams persist to be a concerning sight as they remain in a serious meagre state,” the department pointed out. The Mohale dam’s water levels fell from 13.6% last week to 12.9% this week, a decline from the 33.4% in the same week last year, while the Katse dam is currently at 36.6%, down from the 37.2% recorded last week. The Sterkfontein dam recorded a slight uptick from 93.6% last week to 93.7% this week.
