The average water levels across 11 of the Integrated Vaal River System’s (IVRS’s) 14 dams have dropped during the past week, with the Vaal dam hitting a three-year low. Overall, the system saw a decline from 66.6% last week to 66.1% currently. This is comparatively lower than the 73% recorded during the same week last year. “The drop in the levels of the IVRS has prompted the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) to call on both businesses and households to intensify efforts to save water as much as possible,” the department said in a statement. The Vaal dam’s water levels contracted from 48.9% last week to 48.1% this week, recording continual week-on-week declines over the past few months. This time last year, the critical dam registered water levels of 69.9%. Meanwhile, the Grootdraai dam fell to 85.7% from last week’s 86.7%; however, this was higher than the 73.5% recorded at the same time last year. The water levels of the Sterkfontein dam saw a slight decline from 93.7% last week to 93.6% this week, and an increase on the 93.1% during the comparative period last year. “A strain is continuing to take its toll on Katse and Mohale dams as they continue to drop further this week,” the DWS added. The Mohale dam reached an all-time low as it declined from 12.9% last week to 12.1% this week, a significant drop from the 33.4% recorded during the same week last year. The Katse dam also reported a contraction in water levels, from 36.3% last week to 36.1% this week. However, these current levels are higher than levels of 31.4% at the same time last year. The Bloemhof dam remained unchanged for a second successive week at 99.1%. “The DWS appeals for heightened reduction in the manner water is used, adding that excessive use of water could negatively affect the call for communities to wash hands with water and soap regularly,” the department concluded.
