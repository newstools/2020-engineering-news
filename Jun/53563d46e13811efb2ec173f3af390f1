Kazakhstan Paramount Engineering (KPE), a joint venture between global aerospace and technology business Paramount Group and Kazakhstan partners, has signed an agreement with the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructural Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan to supply the Eurasian nation’s Ministry of Defence with a new batch of 4 x 4 Arlan armoured vehicles to be delivered in 2021. ­ Paramount notes that the armed forces of Kazakhstan have been operating the Arlan for more than three years, with multiple deliveries to the Kazakh Ministry of Defence and law enforcement agencies since August, 2016. The in-country-produced Arlan, which is the winterised variant of Paramount Group’s Marauder, is a mine-resistant armoured platform (MRAP) designed to operate in extreme environments to meet the wide array of mission requirements undertaken by Kazakhstan’s armed forces, such as quick reaction force operations, infantry fire support or long-range border patrol. The Arlan armoured vehicles are all manufactured in Kazakhstan (up to 70% local content) at the 15 000 m2 KPE armoured vehicle production facility in Nursultan. The facilities, operated by over 200 Kazakhstani employees, serve as a domestic base for the provision of modern equipment to Kazakhstan’s special operations forces and its Ministry of Defence, with the capacity to produce more than 200 armoured vehicles a year. Meanwhile, Paramount Land Systems Group executive chairperson John Craig says Covid-19 has highlighted the importance of security of supply during a global emergency. “Now more than ever, governments are looking at the indigenisation of industrial capabilities in a bid to reduce exposure to global market volatility and uncertainty.” In this regard, he notes that Paramount’s “portable manufacturing model” is designed for the creation of local manufacturing capabilities, anywhere in the world. “This model has thrived in Kazakhstan, where we have established a localised hub for indigenous, high-tech manufacturing and high-skills training that has enhanced job creation while supporting the defence capabilities of the nation for future decades.”
