South African rail, port and pipeline company Transnet has welcomed arrests made in connection with the theft of petroleum products and rail equipment. These arrests were achieved through a joint security operation between the company and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), National Intelligence and the South African Police Services. An arrest connected to a petroleum theft incident between the Kendal and Witbank pipeline took place earlier this week. Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities also made arrests connected to the theft of Transnet Freight RailÂ rail equipment, including electrical wires, contact wire and droppers, rail signal rods and rail chairs. Hawks urged residents or any persons living near the pipelines or railway lines to report any suspicious activities.
