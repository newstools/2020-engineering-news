Hunting, self-drive visits to private or public game reserves and national parks, and recreational fishing are among the activities to be allowed under Level 3, Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy has announced. “All fishing, including recreational fishing, is permitted with the exception of charter fishing. [Anglers] must ensure they have a valid permit. All regulations relating to physical distancing, health protocols, movement and the prohibition of groups and gatherings apply. “Wildlife auctions can take place online, while live auctions comprising not more than 50 people may be held where online auctions are not possible.Subsistence hunting for food with the necessary permits is permitted,” she said this week. She further noted that the South African National Parks (SANParks) would publish a list of access-controlled parks that would be open to visitors in the coming days. Self-drive excursions in public and private game reserves would also be permitted. “Visitors to national parks are advised to book and pay online before going on a game drive," the Minister said. Creecy also pointed out that the public would be given seven days’ notice of parks' reopening for self-drive excursions once compliance requirements were met. “While we understand that many nature lovers are keen to get back to our national parks and game reserves, it would be prudent to wait until the relevant authorities are comfortable with their state of preparedness to welcome visitors,” said the Minister. “All the usual protocols with regard to physical distancing, hand-sanitising and wearing of masks will apply at all times” she added.
