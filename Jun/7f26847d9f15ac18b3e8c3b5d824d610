Sugar manufacturer Tongaat Hulett Sugar is the latest large corporation to join Proudly South African (SA) and become part of the “buy local” movement. For over 128 years, Huletts has been a local company and is a key player in the sugar industry that has created 65 000 direct jobs and about 350 000 indirect jobs in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. According to Proudly SA CEO Eustace Mashimbye, adding Huletts Sugar to the stable of members sends an important message to consumers and other corporates. “This large company that has been flying the flag for more than 100 years sees that it has a role to play as part of a greater movement, and we welcome such a high profile and highly visible brand on board.” Tongaat Hulett CEO Gavin Hudson, meanwhile, says he is “delighted [the company is] part of the Proudly SA family” while continuing to play a meaningful role as an employer of choice and also in numerous innovative programmes focused on entrepreneurship and helping communities to lead a better life. Huletts joins the likes of The Foschini Group, Unilever, SA Breweries, National Security, Tsogo Sun, Nestle SA and Absa in supporting the country’s official buy local advocacy campaign.
