The board of the Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone (RBIDZ) on Wednesday announced the appointment of Thabane Zulu as the new CEO from July 1. Zulu takes over from Kaya Ngqaka who was seconded from Dube Trade Port Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to act as CEO. Chairperson Mel Clark said the RBIDZ was confident in Zulu delivering on the vision for the RBIDZ to become a driver of socioeconomic development in response to challenges posed by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the need to restart the economy, as was outlined by KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube. Zulu holds an MBA and has extensive experience in government administration and in economic development. He previously held the position of Director for International Trade and Development for Africa and the Middle East at the Department of Trade and Industry, showcasing his exposure to the investment facilitation sector. Most recently Zulu has served as a Director-General in the Department of Energy. Government has designed SEZs to develop export-orientated industries, attract foreign direct investments, ensure technology transfer and create employment opportunities. Dube-Ncube said the SEZs should also help in broadening the municipal revenue collection base to improve the quality of life in the municipal areas, as well as the quality of municipal services.
