After careful deliberation on the economic impacts of Covid-19 and to safeguard the health of all participants, the Manufacturing Indaba has announced that it has decided to postpone the 2020 Provincial Manufacturing Indaba conferences and exhibitions, which were due to take place in August, in Durban; October, in Port Elizabeth; and November, in Cape Town. The events will now be held in 2021, with the exact dates to be announced soon. “We understand the gravity of the situation for all manufacturing professionals who use the Manufacturing Indaba provincial flagship events as a platform to grow their business, accelerate their professional development and to make meaningful connections,” the organisers state. To support the continued engagement and having carefully considered health issues and the need for economic activity, the Gauteng edition of the Manufacturing Indaba will proceed on December 9 to 10 at Gallagher Convention Centre. The organisers believe this December date is as late as possible in the 2020 calendar year and, with economic activity resuming post the extensive lockdown period, manufacturers will be back in business mode in December. “We trust you will continue supporting our position and stay committed to the events. We invite all our provincial manufacturers to join us in Gauteng this year and we will be back in your province in 2021,” the organisers say.
