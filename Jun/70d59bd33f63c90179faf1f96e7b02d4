Registered freelance tourist guides who have been impacted on by the measures implemented to help slow the spread of Covid-19 will soon receive some financial assistance as the Department of Tourism prepares to roll out a three-month relief fund. This follows an announcement by Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane of a R30-million fund to provide financial relief of R1 500 a month to these guides. “We have put aside R30-million to financially assist tourist guides over the next three months as the country slowly begins to ease disaster management regulations, and reopen some sectors of our economy. “The Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on tourism and many tourist guides have been left destitute without any form of income,” said the Minister. She added that the guides would not have to apply for the financial assistance. “Information on guides will be sourced from the databases maintained by the Provincial Registrars of Tourist Guides in all nine provinces and verified with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF)," said the Minister. Kubayi-Ngubane said registered tourist guides, who have valid identification according to the DHA and who are neither registered with the UIF nor claimed any financial support through the Tourism Relief Fund, will receive financial relief from the department. “Provincial Registrars will ensure that all the relevant information on their respective databases are correct, particularly the contact details of all their tourist guides.” The Tourism Minister encouraged all tourist guides to provide their updated contact information to their respective Provincial Registrars. “This is crucial, as cardless payments will be made in order to expedite the payment process. “Once this exercise is completed, freelance tourist guides that meet the requirements will receive payment relief,” she said.
