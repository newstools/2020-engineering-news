Of the R16.5-billion disbursed by the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) as part of the Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) benefits payment, almost half has gone to Gauteng, benefitting 1.5-million of the 3.46-million workers who have been beneficiaries. In monetary terms, this amounts to R7.91-billion and the workers who have been given the cash injection had their claims lodged by 111 385 employers. The Northern Cape had the least number of claimants, with R163-million paid to the province for 32 141 workers represented by 4 176 employers. The second highest recipient province is the Western Cape, with R2.7-billion disbursed so far to 549 156 workers represented by 54 077 employers. KwaZulu-Natal is the third-largest recipient, with over R2.4-billion paid to 523 578 workers claimed on their behalf by 42 136 employers, while the Eastern Cape is fourth, with disbursements of just under R1-billion distributed to 186 789 workers in the province represented by 18 495 employers.

Ordinarily, feedback for payment or nonpayment with reasons thereof together with acceptance or approval is sent to employers via automated process within 24 hours through email address provided in addition to the online portal. The UIF also continues to pay ordinary benefits.
