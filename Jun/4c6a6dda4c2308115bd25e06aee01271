The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has reopened the left lane of Christiaan de Wet road following repairs carried out last month. A section of road behind the Clearwater Shopping Mall, towards Ontdekkers road, was closed off to traffic in May following a collapse of the road, owing to damaged stormwater infrastructure. JRA plans to install a full drainage system and rehabilitate other sections of the road that have been damaged by the water in due course.
