Global energy company Engie has become the newest member of leading global mining industry research organisation Mining3. Engie says it joins Mining3 in its next phase of hydrogen research to co-create hydrogen solutions to help reach carbon neutrality for the mining sector in the coming decades. Mining3 is dedicated to developing and delivering transformational technology that improves the productivity, sustainability and safety of the global mining industry. Engie joins other members of the organisation including original-equipment manufacturers and research organisations such as Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Newcrest, Komatsu, Dyno Nobel, the University of Queensland, OZ Minerals, South32, AngloGold Ashanti, Caterpillar and Value. Mining3 CEO Paul Lever says the organisation has already identified a number of projects that align with Engie’s strategy and the mining industry’s current and future needs. “Our priorities at Mining3 are focused on developing next-generation mining systems and technologies. We see sustainability drivers, particularly renewables, as key components for this strategy in the coming years. We plan to be at the forefront of this research and I believe we can achieve this with Engie as a partner on renewable hydrogen,” he states. Engie hydrogen business unit CEO Michele Azalbert says Engie is delighted to join Mining3 and its members to co-develop renewable hydrogen-based solutions for the mining industry. “These solutions will help the industry players reach their carbon-neutrality goals, as well as help reduce emissions for countries where mining is a key industry, such as Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru and South Africa, where we are developing hydrogen projects. “Through partnerships and collaboration with other experts at Mining3, Engie is looking forward to delivering renewable hydrogen solutions to the entire mining ecosystem.”
