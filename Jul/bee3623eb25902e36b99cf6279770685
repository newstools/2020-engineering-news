Data network provider rain and Pargo have more than doubled the number of pick-up points available for rain’s fourth-generation (4G) Sim cards amid a growing demand for the data-only Sim cards. There are now 260 Pargo pick-up points at selected Clicks stores across Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape, North West, the Eastern Cape and Free State. However, customers can still choose to have their Sim cards delivered to their homes free of charge through the rain website or by ordering through Takealot and on demand delivery by Mr D Food. If the Sim is required right away, customers can, on the rain website, select the ‘pick up a 4G Sim today’ option for collection at their nearest participating Clicks store. The Sim, which is free to collect, can be activated, as well as Rica registered, online, with seven days of free unlimited data awarded upon selection of a data plan. The plans include unlimited 4G data 24/7 for R479 month-to-month and unlimited off-peak, which offers 19 hours of unlimited data every day, at R250 a month.
