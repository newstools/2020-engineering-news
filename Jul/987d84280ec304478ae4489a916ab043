Bearing manufacturer SKF is aiming to have its factories carbon neutral by 2030, the Swedish group has announced. The company has already decreased its manufacturing carbon footprint by 36% since 2015 and is operating two carbon-neutral factories. The 2030 target will cover SKF’s own manufacturing operations, thus its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. It will be achieved by process improvements, energy efficiency machinery and procurement and generation of renewable energy. SKF may also consider high-quality carbon offsets, if need be. President and CEO Alrik Danielson says reducing emissions has become necessary to combat the climate crisis and, as a global company, it is important that SKF shows leadership. “We strive to reduce the climate impact in the full value chain, from the raw material we buy, to the customer’s use, and beyond. The responsibility to act starts in our own operations – we will act with speed and purpose to achieve this goal. “Carbon neutrality will further improve our competitiveness and aligns the interests of SKF, our customers and the environment.” SKF Asia industrial sales president Patrick Tong believes that climate change presents huge challenges, but also opportunities, which the company will leverage by delivering environmental and economic value to its customers and other stakeholders. “This is key to SKF’s strategy, which is based on sustainable development.” SKF is represented in more than 130 countries and has around 17 000 distribution locations globally.
