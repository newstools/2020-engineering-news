Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) director-generalÂ Advocate Sam Vukela has been placed on precautionary suspension, effective from July 29, pending the finalisation of disciplinary processes instituted against him. In a statement, Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia De Lille said the action follows an instruction from President Cyril Ramaphosa in March, wherein he delegated some of his powers to De Lille to initiate disciplinary processes against Vukela. This process follows reports into two investigations, namely a report by PwC which investigated allegations of irregularities related to the provision of moveable infrastructure for official funerals; and a report by the Public Service Commission, which investigated allegations of irregular appointments within the senior management service of the department. An internal disciplinary process that will be chaired by a senior advocate will be convened in due course, she said.
