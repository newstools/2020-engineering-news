Clean tech company Swedish Stirling and South African ferrochrome producer Samancor Chrome have entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding the possible installation of up to 135 PWR BLOKs at Samancor Chrome’s TC Smelter, Ferrometals and Tubatse Alloys smelters. On December 13, 2019, Swedish Stirling and Samancor Chrome entered into an energy conversion service agreement for the installation of a pilot facility with one PWR BLOK unit at Samancor Chrome’s TC Smelter facility. Swedish Stirling’s PWR BLOKs use Stirling technology to convert thermal energy to electricity. The parties are discussing the possible installation of up to 45 PWR BLOKs at each of the three smelters. This will account for 18 MW of capacity at each of the smelters, and a total of 54 MW of capacity.
