Energy multinational Total has announced a gas discovery in shallow waters off the Egyptian coast that could deliver an estimated 100-million standard cubic feet of gas a day, as well as up to 800 bbl/d of condensate. "These results support our strategy to allocate a significant share of our exploration budget to the search of hydrocarbons in the vicinity of existing infrastructures, and these resources have low development costs since they can rapidly be tied-in and put into production," says Total Exploration senior VP Kevin McLachlan. Total, BP and Eni have made a gas discovery within the Bashrush well on the North El Hammad licence, located 11 km off the Egyptian coast. The well encountered 102 m net gas pay in high-quality sandstones of the Abu Madi formation. A production test was conducted with flow rates of up to 32-million standard cubic feet of gas a day, limited by testing facilities. Future plans foresee development through tie-in to nearby existing infrastructure. Total holds a working interest of 25% in the North El Hammad licence, alongside operator Eni (37.5%) and BP (37.5%).
