Solar energy industry body, the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) has announced the names of its new board members. This follows their election during a recent annual general meeting. The board members are Mettle Solar Investments’ Frank Spencer, ED Platform’s Maloba Tshehla, DPA Africa’s Norman Moyo and Canadian Solar’s Wido Schnabel who was also elected SAPVIA chairperson. The board will serve a two-year term of office. Outgoing board members are Simon Haw, Kittessa Roro and Busi Nxumalo. SAPVIA was formed a decade ago by six individuals with a passion to have renewable energy included in the Integrated Resource Plan 2010. The organisation now represents 378 companies and service providers across South Africa. SAPVIA COO Nivesh Govender says the organisation’s new board members bring with them a wealth of knowledge and expertise. “We are enormously grateful for their willingness to commit time, energy and expertise to building the solar and photovoltaic industry.” He adds that the industry body has come a long way since its inception and that it is excited to step into this new chapter with a multi-talented team steering it. A key area of focus for the year ahead, Govender says, will be the role that the renewables sector can play in helping to kickstart the South African economy post-pandemic.
