JSE-listed real estate investment trust (Reit) Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) has become the first shopping centre owner in South Africa to receive the Covid-19 Compliant certification from SAFE Shopping Centres. The independent Swedish certification body SAFE Shopping Centres has audited and certified the operational procedures and routines implemented by all L2D’s shopping centres in response to Covid-19. L2D is a precinct-focused, retail-centred Reit with a portfolio of retail assets in South Africa, comprising six shopping centres, of which some are super-regional shopping centres. The company notes that that certification is proof that the portfolio of shopping centres follows all recommendations from health authorities and is operating in accordance with the highest international safety standards. Through Safe Spaces, which underpins L2D’s building blocks to help futureproof its shopping centres and set them apart, L2D aims to drive a clearly defined mall strategy that ensures the highest level of safety and security in its mall environments for tenants, shoppers and all stakeholders amid the pandemic. L2D COO Jonathan Sinden notes that L2D collaborated with JHI Retail and SAFE Shopping Centres to increase the various safety measures already in place at the Reit’s properties. “We are encouraged that the efforts that we continue to make to keep our environments safe during this time, meet global standards and remain in the best interests of all our stakeholders. "This enables us to continue our operations in a safe and responsible way, prioritising the wellbeing of our tenants and our visitors.”
