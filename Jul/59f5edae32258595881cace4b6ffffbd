State-owned freight logistics company Transnet has appointed Nonkululeko Dlamini group CFO, with effect from July 1. Dlamini, who will also serve as an executive director on the Transnet board, is a seasoned executive, with almost 20 years’ experience in financial roles at State-owned companies, having spent a number of years at the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and Eskom. During July, Dlamini will still assist the IDC, where she had served as CFO for the past five years, with the transition and handover process. In her role as Transnet CFO, Dlamini will ensure financial prudence across the organisation, manage Transnet’s funding strategy and ensure the group’s financial sustainability. Dlamini is a chartered accountant and holds a BComm degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, and a Higher Diploma in accounting from the University of Natal, now the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The Transnet board also thanks Mark Gregg-Macdonald, who has been the acting group CFO since March. He will revert to his role as the group treasurer.
