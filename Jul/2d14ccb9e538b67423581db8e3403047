Proudly South African (SA) this week launched its new “Buy Local” consumer education campaign that will go live on various platforms, including television, on July 3. The campaign calls on all South African citizens to contribute to putting the local economy and South Africans back to work by making "buy local" choices. The new campaign features Dr John Kani, who was both the face and the voice of the buy local campaign’s previous advert. In the new campaign, Kani takes on the role of the State President, who is seen delivering an address to the nation. The television commercial element, called ‘Game Time’ was shot in one day in Johannesburg and Alexandra. With unemployment figures now standing at a record high of over 30.1%, the South African economy is in dire straits, and the debt levels of the country, and those of its citizens, have already escalated to dangerous levels over the last few months. These have been further impacted by the lockdown and the economic inactivity of lockdown restriction at Levels 4 and 5. Proudly SA says it is imperative for the country to get behind the “buy local” movement and take the collective responsibility of putting the economy back on its feet. From the real President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, to the fictitious one of the commercial, there is a call to action to support local businesses and for all sectors of society to participate in the regeneration of the economy, Proudly SA states. If the country fails to heed this call, the period of economic recovery for South Africa will be significantly longer and economic hardship more protracted, it adds. Proudly SA CEO Eustace Mashimbye says the organisation is hopeful that the commercial will resonate with the South African public and that they will see the benefits of buying locally manufactured goods, while also understanding the consequences of not supporting the country’s own businesses and individuals.
