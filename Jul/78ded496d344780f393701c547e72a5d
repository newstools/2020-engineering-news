Gas supplierÂ Afrox has assured the public that there is no shortage of medical oxygen in South Africa, contrary to what some media reports may have suggested. Afrox, as the sole supplier of medical oxygen to State hospitals and clinics, as well as to privately owned hospitals and clinics, is working closely with its customers to maintain adequate cylinder stocks and says it has met all the medical oxygen demands from its customers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the company has undertaken an end-to-end oxygen supply chain risk review and business continuity planning, which included an in-depth review of its oxygen supply chain. Afrox assures it has emergency scenarios in place and that it is testing and implementing those on an ongoing basis to adjust where appropriate. In the unlikely event of shortages, oxygen supply will be prioritised for the healthcare sector. Additionally, Afrox says it is possible to take non-medical grade oxygen and refine the product to meet medical oxygen grade standards.
