Listed industrial group Bell Equipment on Friday dismissed rumours that it had received an offer for a shareholding in the company. Bell was responding to an article that appeared in financial daily Business Day, which reports that the group had received a takeover offer from Chinese firm LiuGong months ago, citing a shareholder. “The company has not received any offer regarding the acquisition of a shareholding in Bell Equipment," it said in a voluntary announcement to the JSE. "The board has not been made aware of any pending transactions in respect of takeover of the company by any third party,” Bell confirmed.
