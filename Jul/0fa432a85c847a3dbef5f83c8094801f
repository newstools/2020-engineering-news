Platinum group metals miner Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat), together with the North West Department of Health has officially opened the 200-bed Royal Bafokeng Platinum Field Hospital, in Rustenburg, at a cost of about R10-million, to support government’s already overburdened resources in the fight against Covid-19. Working with the provincial Department of Health and the Bojanala District Health Department, RBPlat converted its unused South Shaft Change House at the Maseve mine, in the province, into the hospital to provide initial Covid-19 medical treatment to its employees and communities. The 2 940 m² treatment facility includes five wards. Each bed has its own television and personal lockable locker to store patients' valuables and is individually screened off from other patient beds for privacy. The wards have also been installed with sani-disc ultraviolet lights to kill any airborne diseases, as well as 108 Caribbean Ray 2 000 W infrared heaters. In a statement on July 1, the facility was described as being well-ventilated and able to cater for mild to moderate Covid-19 cases. All required medical facilities and healthcare professionals are also available. Speaking at the official opening, RBPlat CEO Steve Phiri said the pandemic and the increase in positive cases in South Africa “is a cause for concern and has encouraged [the company] to identify projects that can offer support to [the company’s] employees, communities and the government”. RBPlat has already implemented several projects to support the needy and vulnerable in its surrounding community, as well as sourced quarantine and isolation facilities at Sundown Ranch for employees and the community, to be used as required. The handover of the field hospital to the provincial Department of Health forms part of the company’s collective responsibility to “make a real difference in communities during this difficult time”.
