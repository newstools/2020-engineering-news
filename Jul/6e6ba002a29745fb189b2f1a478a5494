President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed the Border Management Authority Bill into law as part of government’s vision for an integrated and well-coordinated border management service, legitimate trade and secure travel. The new legislation is effective from July 21 and is in accordance with international and domestic law. The Presidency says the new law will contribute to country security, as well as ease of trade and movement of persons and goods in and out of the country. The new law allows for the establishment, organisation, regulation, functions and control of the Border Management Authority, the appointment of its Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners and officials, as well as their terms of office, conditions of service and functions and powers. “The new Border Management Authority will, as an objective of the Act, replace the current challenge of different agencies and organs of government all playing different roles in managing aspects of border control,” the Presidency said. The law also provides for the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Consultative Committee, Border Technical Committee and advisory committees, for the review or appeal of decisions of officers, and the definition of offences and the levying of penalties.
