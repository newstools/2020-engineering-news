The average water levels of the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) have continued to decrease, with levels this week dropping to 63.7% from 64.2% last week and 69.9% during the same time in the preceding year. The levels of the Vaal dam, one of the 14 dams in the IVRS, continue plunging downwards as the country continues to slip deeper into the dry-winter season. The dam water levels now stand at 43.4%, which is down from last week’s 44.1% and 65.3% during the same week last year. This is prompting the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) to call for behavioural change on the part of water consumers. The Bloemhof dam fell this week, recording a decline from 100.1% last week to 99.3%. During the same week last year, the dam was floating at full capacity at 101.7%. The water levels of the Mohale dam are at an all-time low of 8.5% this week, down from levels of 9% last week and 33.3% last year, while the Katse dam’s water levels continue to worsen weekly. However, while the dam fell from last week’s 32.3% to 31.6% this week, it is an improvement on the 23.9% recorded during the same period last year. The Grootdraai dam water levels fell from 82.8% last week to 82.4% this week, surpassing the 68% it recorded last year at the same time. For the second consecutive week, the Sterkfontein dam in the Free State stood at 93.9%, up from 92.5% at the same time last year. The DWS in Gauteng urged water consumers to work cooperatively with their respective municipalities to lessen the rate of water use to prevent a dire situation during this winter season. “The department believes that if consumers used water sparingly, it is possible that everyone will have enough water to see them through until the rainy season begins in the next few months.”
