The Automobile Association (AA) says fuel prices are set to increase in August despite the strengthening rand. The association was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. "As matters currently stand, petrol is likely to increase by between nine and 16 cents a litre, diesel by up to 48 cents, and illuminating paraffin by 43 cents," it said. The AA said that, while oil traded in a fairly tight range throughout July, there was a "substantial climb" at the beginning of the month.
