The Coega Development Corporation (CDC), the developer and operator of the Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ), has been appointed as the implementing agent to develop and operate the Tshwane Automotive Special Economic Zone (TASEZ). The CDC, as a public entity, is the implementing agent of choice owing to its expertise in mega and complex infrastructure projects, says CDC brand and marketing head Dr Ayanda Vilakazi. The multibillion-rand TASEZ is a project of the Gauteng province, City of Tshwane and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition’s (DTIC’s) SEZ programme. “SEZs are catalysts for employment, transformation, socio-economic development and industry growth,” says Vilakazi. “The CDC’s appointment demonstrates our resilience in negotiation, having secured a multibillion-rand project under a difficult operating environment amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Coega has ISO-certified systems and processes that guarantee effective delivery of projects within scope, time, and budget.” The TASEZ was launched in 2019. It is punted as Africa’s first ‘Automotive City’. Nissan, BMW and Ford all assemble vehicles in Tshwane, with the area also hosting several truck and component manufacturers. The R3.5-billion SEZ, funded by government, will be housed next door to the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa plant, in Silverton. The 162 ha project will be developed in phases.
