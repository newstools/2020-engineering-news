Management of the OR Tambo International Airport has appealed to passengers to ensure the required traveller health questionnaire is completed before arrival at the entrance to the domestic terminal. Airport spokesperson Samukelo Khambule says the airport is facilitating greater numbers of passengers as travel for business purposes gradually recovers. “In recent days, we have begun experiencing longer queues at the terminal entrance points because many passengers have not completed the required health questionnaire [beforehand]. "This means that there are increasing numbers of passengers gathering around the entrance filling in the forms,” she says. Khambule says that providing completed traveller health questionnaires is a requirement before passengers are allowed into the terminal buildings. “So far, we have experienced good cooperation from passengers in terms of abiding by the compulsory wearing of masks and other regulations, including the provision of the necessary business travel documents. “We therefore appeal to passengers to avoid delays at the entrance by ensuring they have filled in the forms before they get to the airport.” The traveller health questionnaire is provided on airline websites when making a flight reservation.
