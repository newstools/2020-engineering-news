The Compensation Fund reports that 2 361 claims have been lodged for compensation by employees who have been exposed to Covid-19 at work from April 1 to July 13. Of the claims lodged, 1 412 have been lodged directly with the Compensation Fund, while 900 were lodged with Rand Mutual Assurance and 49 with Federated Employees. Of those lodged directly with the fund, the highest number of claimants were from the Western Cape, with 1 068 claims. Liability has been accepted for 590 cases, while 115 cases have been repudiated and 363 are pending adjudication. The second most affected province with regard to claimants is the Eastern Cape, with 160 claims of which 78 have been accepted, four repudiated and 78 are pending adjudication. Overall, of all claims received directly by the fund, 55% have been accepted, 9.7% have been rejected and 35.1% are pending adjudication. “It is important to note that when we say the claim has been repudiated, this could change if we are given more information about the particular claim. This then should not be read as having had the door slammed in the face of the claimants. “Where we accept the claim, this means that we have accepted the claim as a valid occupational injury or disease and we accept responsibility for the costs related to the claim (medical aid costs and disability costs). "Those awaiting adjudication means the claims have been received but no decision has been made on the claim due to outstanding information or claim has not been attended to as yet,” explains Compensation Fund commissioner Vuyo Mafata.
