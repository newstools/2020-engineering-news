Emerging domestic natural gas and helium producer Renergen has completed the design of its Virginia gas plant, 22 days ahead of schedule. The significant achievement marks the completion of the fourth major milestone at its Virginia gas project in the Free State. The company is working towards a production start date in 2021. “Despite the challenging environment, all teams continue to work extremely hard to deliver on [the company’s] stated goal of starting production in 2021,” CEO Stefano Marani confirmed. Phase 1 of the Virginia project will produce around 50 t/d of liquefied natural gas (LNG), while Phase 2 will see this increase to the LNG equivalent of about 75 000 ℓ/d of diesel. Phase 2 will be completed by 2023. In addition to the LNG, the company’s pilot project also includes helium resources, which will go to the export market, and will initially provide 350 kg/d of helium as part of the Phase 1 development. Output will be increased to up to 10 000 kg/d of helium in Phase 2.
