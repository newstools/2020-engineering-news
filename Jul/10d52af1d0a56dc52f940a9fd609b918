UK development finance institution CDC Group has committed $100-million to Helios Investors IV, the fourth private equity fund raised by Helios Investment Partners, an Africa-focused private equity firm. The pan-African generalist fund will invest in and build companies across the continent. With a well-established local presence in Lagos and Nairobi, offices in Europe and strong networks across the continent, Helios has grown significantly since its establishment in 2004 and has invested in businesses that operate in more than 30 African countries. Helios has a strong record in African private equity across its three predecessor funds, having invested more than $3-billion and created over 9 000 new jobs in diverse sectors ranging from financial services to education and telecommunications since 2008. CDC’s investment is expected to be instrumental in accelerating job creation, facilitating sustainable employment, and the commitment is slated to support recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic by boosting economic growth across the continent. CDC is aligned with Helios on its current good practice on environmental, social and governance management and supports the firm in continuing to lead in this respect, which is expected to have a demonstration effect on the wider market. Helios has committed to aligning with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework. CDC said that this countercyclical commitment from the group – the first since its last investment in a Helios fund in 2009 – signals confidence in the firm and has the potential to catalyse further capital into the fund.
