Industry organisation, the National Liquor Traders Council (NLTC ), announced on July 27 that it aims to raise R100-million to support 34 500 taverns over a two- to three-month period by providing food parcels and other necessary supplies. NLTC convener Lucky Ntimane said the organisation was hoping to raise the funds through industry partners and the general public. Through associations affiliated with the NLTC, it would identify taverns in need and respond accordingly. The NLTC also sought support for its taverns during the ban on alcohol sales with a one-off payment of R20 000 for each tavern from government totalling R690-million. Ntimane also called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to outline when the ban on alcohol sales would be lifted. Taverns contribute about R40-billion to R60-billion a year to the economy, specifically the township economy, as estimated by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition. The ban threatens the livelihoods of more than 34 500 tavern owners, with a knock-on effect that could see more than 500 000 people facing economic ruin. Further, the NLTC is also embarking on a programme to mobilise the township liquor trade to honour the President’s call for a social compact to help rebuild the economy and address specific issues in partnership with all stakeholders. “If the government acts now and lifts the ban, we can begin to recover and prevent this catastrophe,” said Ntimane.
