South African data-only mobile network rain and information and communications technology giant Huawei have launched a commercial standalone fifth-generation (5G) network in Cape Town. The standalone network, believed to be one of the first in Africa, is built on rain's own sites to enhance the company’s fixed-wireless broadband (FWA) service experience in Sea Point, Claremont, Goodwood, Bellville, Durbanville and Cape Town’s City Centre. “Standalone 5G will further improve 5G network performance with increased uplink rate, lower latency and improved reliability, ushering in high-end cloud virtual reality and cloud gaming services, more diversified enterprise and home broadband services,” said rain chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga. Powered by Huawei's 5G solutions, including its converged core solution and massive multiple input/multiple output, or MiMo, technologies, the standalone 5G will enable digital transformation, such as smart healthcare, smart ports, smart mining and smart manufacturing, in South Africa. “Standalone 5G will demonstrate how 5G is powerful in realising South Africa’s Fourth Industrial Revolution future. “We will work with [our] strategic partner to further expand our 5G networks and bring the best service and experience to our customers,” Dlanga concluded.
