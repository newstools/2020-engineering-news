Gauteng Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile has urged  the City of Johannesburg Municipal Council to put the interest of the residents of the City first following its failure to approve an annual budget for the start of the municipal financial year 2020/21. The Gauteng Provincial Executive Council has called on the Municipal Council to urgently convene and approve the budget by no later than Friday. The Gauteng Provincial Executive Council says failure to pass a municipal budget will have grave implications. According to Section 139(4) of the Constitution the relevant provincial executive must intervene if a municipality cannot or does not fulfil an obligation in terms of the Constitution or legislation to approve a budget or any revenue-raising measures necessary to give effect to the budget. Steps taken by the Provincial Executive Council can include dissolving the Municipal Council and ​appointing an administrator until a newly elected Municipal Council has been declared elected and ​approving a temporary budget or revenue-raising measures to provide for the continued functioning of the municipality.
