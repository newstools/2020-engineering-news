State-owned power utility Eskom has warned of possible load-shedding in the peak demand hours of 17:00 to 21:00 from July 9 to 12. The utility has urged the public to reduce electricity use as the power generation system is severely constrained. Eskom explains that this is the result of a tripped generation unit at the Tutuka power station, as well as at a tripped unit the Lethabo power station, while return-to-service of generation units at Duvha and Kendal power stations have been delayed. Any additional breakdowns will compromise the utilityâ€™s ability to supply the country through the peak demand period.
