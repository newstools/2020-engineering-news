AutoTrader data shows that the value of used-car sales through its platform increased by 46% month-on-month in June, while the market in the Western Cape – which saw a 101% increase in sales last month – is on the boil. The Volkswagen Polo Vivo was the most popular used car sold in the Western Cape in June, says AutoTrader, which is the country’s largest digital automotive marketplace. More than 25 000 used vehicles worth R7.3-billion were sold on AutoTrader during the month of June – versus 17 000 vehicles in May, at a value of R4.9-billion. Vehicle searches increased in June too – up from 39.9-million in May to 43.9-million in June. This encouraging growth in the market is positive evidence of changing consumer confidence, says AutoTrader CEO George Mienie. “The move to [Alert] Level 3 has clearly seen consumer sentiment improving.” Providing proof that South African motorists remain brand loyal, AutoTrader’s top five used-car brands (sold and searched for) for June remained unchanged from May. “In both months, Volkswagen ruled the roost in the sales statistics, followed by Toyota, Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. BMW reigned supreme in the search statistics, followed by Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Audi,” says Mienie. There were a number of changes in June when it comes to specific models. The Toyota Fortuner performed far better in June, improving its position on the most sold list from seventh in May, to fifth in June. The Jeep Wrangler was knocked out of the ten most-sold individual models, falling to number 23 in June. Also, the perennially popular Toyota Hilux bounced back to the top of the podium for single-cab sales, overtaking the Nissan NP200.
