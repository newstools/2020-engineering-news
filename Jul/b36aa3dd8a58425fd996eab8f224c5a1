The US government through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has delivered a second shipment of 100 ventilators to South Africa to assist with its national response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. USAID will also train up to 10 000 critical care nurses and physicians and support supply chain assistance for oxygen therapy. USAID has procured 25 high flow nasal cannula oxygen units for the Western Cape Department of Health. To date, the US government has committed over $41.6-million (R767-million) to South Africa’s Covid-19 response. The US previously delivered its first shipment of ventilators to South Africa in May, which are being used to treat patients in Gauteng, the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape. The US is in liaison with the South African government and other stakeholders to identify priority areas for investment and has urged other donors to contribute to the global effort to combat Covid-19.
