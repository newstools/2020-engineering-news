Industry organisation the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Safety Association of South Africa has changed its name to the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association of South Africa (LPGSA). The name change reflects a strategic shift to broaden LPGSA’s mandate to not only promote the safe, compliant use of LPG but also to advocate for LPG’s exceptional benefits in comparison to other energies in South Africa, the organisation says. It emphasises that safety will remain a core focus of LPGSA’s work and that the association will continue to offer training courses and certify installers, manufacturers and distributors of LPG and LPG equipment. “The LPG industry in South Africa is entering a phase of significant growth, driven by increased supply as a result of new import and storage terminals in Cape Town and Richards Bay, and increased demand as a result of an electricity grid under extreme pressure. "LPG is a perfect component of South Africa’s eventual energy mix, especially for efficient, low-cost water, food and space heating,” the organisation says.
