Poultry producer Astral has informed stakeholders that both its chairperson Dr Theuns Eloff and CEO Chris Schutte have tested positive for Covid-19. Eloff is self-isolating at home and is receiving medical treatment for his symptoms, while Schutte is under strict supervision by physicians while self-isolating at home, since he is a high-risk patient after having undergone cardiovascular surgery last year. Astral says all its board meetings have been held through digital platforms since the start of the hard lockdown at the end of March and that its executive management team is in place to deal with operational matters while Eloff and Schutte recover. CFO Daan Ferreira has been appointed as the central contact person during Schutteâ€™s absence.
