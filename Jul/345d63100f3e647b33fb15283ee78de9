State-owned Transnet says it is closely monitoring adverse weather conditions along the country’s coastline, to determine when it is safe to resume port operations. The stormy weather, rough sea conditions and swells in excess of 9 m led to the disruption of outgoing vessel movements at the Port of Cape Town on July 13. Five vessels were delayed from entering the port and berthing remained on hold by 12:00 on July 14. Transnet says safety remains a top priority and that it will continue to monitor the swells closely, adjust plans accordingly, and test the swells and allow vessels to enter the port once safe to do so. The weather conditions are expected to continue until July 16. The ports of Port Elizabeth and Ngqura, in the Eastern Cape, which are also wind bound, have taken all necessary action to ensure the safety of employees and that of property, notes Transnet. Meanwhile, terminal operations at the Port of Cape Town have been temporarily stopped with all gantry cranes and cargo operation equipment safely secured.
