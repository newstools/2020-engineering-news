The Organised Crime Unit of the South Africa Police Service (SAPS) and the Protection Services of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) have arrested two suspects in possession of stolen PRASA assets, worth almost R2-million. One of the suspects is an employee of PRASA at management level at a depot in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. The other is a former PRASA manager who owns and runs an electrical and railway equipment supply company. The arrests follow an investigation, which included a warrant to search premises of the manufacturing company. About 12 point machines and 50 signal tuning units, all belonging to PRASA, were recovered. The investigation continues and further arrests are possible, says PRASA. The agency adds that the process to recruit 3 100 security personnel on to PRASA’s payroll continues. The new recruits are expected to start their guard duties in August. This follows the decision by PRASA administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo to insource the security function after several security contracts, found to be irregularly awarded, were terminated.

Four PRASA employees were dismissed in June for their involvement in the procurement of the contracts.
