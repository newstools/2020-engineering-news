The Mpumalanga executive council has approved an apportionment of R1.6-billion to the departments of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs; Health; and Education to augment the Covid-19 containment measures in the province and improve service delivery. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, in her capacity as chairperson of the executive council, says this shows shows the provincial response is reflective of the ward-based approach to containing the pandemic. “The Department of Agriculture Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs is to direct a portion of its allocation to the provision of water. The Department of Education is to start with minor maintenance work in schools to ensure effective teaching and learning,” she notes. She adds that the provincial health department will use its portion of the funds to continue to augment the clinical response to the pandemic. Further, the Premier notes Cabinet’s endorsement of the appointment of some MECs as district delivery model champions. “The appointed MECs will be working closely with Ministers and Deputy Ministers. In the Ehlanzeni district municipality, Deputy Minister Mcebisi Skwatsha will be working with MEC Mandla Msibi; in the Gert Sibande district municipality, Deputy Minister Thabang Makwetla will be working with MEC Gabisile Shabalala; and in the Nkangala district municipality Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane will be working with MEC Bonakele Majuba,” the Premier reports.
