UK private-sector national flag carrier British Airways (BA), the world’s largest current operator of the renowned Boeing 747 ‘Jumbo jet’, has announced that it was going to immediately retire its entire fleet of the famous type. BA has a fleet of 31 of the Jumbo jets, all being 747-400 models. “It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,” stated the company. “It is unlikely our magnificent ‘queen of the skies’ will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic.” BA, which is part of the International Airlines Group, originally planned to retire its 747s in 2024. BA predecessor airline, State-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation, operated its first 747 flight (from London to New York) in 1971. At one point, BA operated 57 of the type – only Japan Airlines had a bigger fleet, with more than 100, reported the British Broadcasting Corporation. The airline said that it intended to operate more of its flights using more modern, more fuel efficient aircraft, such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. These would assist it in reaching a net-zero carbon emissions level by 2050. BA had previously warned that the Covid-19-caused collapse in, and likely slow post-pandemic recovery of, air traffic had put some 12 000 jobs in the company at risk, or about 25% of its total workforce. This figure included 1 130 pilots out of a total of 4 346. Earlier this month, the airline reached an agreement with the pilots union over job cuts and pay cuts (the latter being to minimise the former). Any effect on pilot numbers caused by the decision to rapidly accelerate the retirement of the 747s would be subject to further negotiations and consultations with the pilots union. BA’s great rival, Virgin Atlantic, had previously announced that it was going to retire all its 747s. It is likely that BA’s decision marks the end of scheduled 747 operations by UK airlines. February last year marked the fiftieth anniversary of the first flight of the 747, which Boeing is phasing out of production.
