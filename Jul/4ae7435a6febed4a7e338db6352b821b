Stellenbosch University's (SU's) new School for Data Science and Computational Thinking has opened the African Data Science Academy (ADSA) and is offering two courses in July. "Many universities across the world have identified data science as a very important discipline, because of the data-rich world we find ourselves in," SU School for Data Science and Computational Thinking director Professor Kanshukan Rajaratnam says. The School launched the ADSA in June. It is administering the two courses with the internationally known African Doctoral Academy, which brings a wealth of experience in running such courses. Further, the School is set up to focus not only on data science, but also on computational thinking, thereby offering a unique value proposition to students, researchers and industry, states the School.
