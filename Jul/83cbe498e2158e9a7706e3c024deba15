Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie was been named Alumnus of the Year 2019 by the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB). The award is reportedly the highest honour given to alumni of the university on behalf of the Alumni Association. The award formally recognises alumni who have excelled as responsible leaders in the private or public sector, or in an entrepreneurial venture. USB director Professor Piet Naudé says Fourie has played a key role in expanding Capitec as a socially conscious financial institution and this resonates well with the business school’s vision to create value for a better world. “His achievements are testimony of his significant impact on the global business environment.” Fourie has been with Capitec since it was established in 2001 and has been its CEO for the last six years. Under his leadership Capitec received JSE Top 100 Company Awards in 2018 and 2019 and received a top spot for South Africa’s Best Digital Bank in 2019 in the annual InSites-Consulting report on customer satisfaction with digital banking services in South Africa.
