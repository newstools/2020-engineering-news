Africa-focused independent power producer Tembo Power has announced that its strategic partnership with WK Construction has been extended to the 7.5 MW Dama and 12 MW Siguvyaye run-of-river hydropower projects located in the south-west region of Burundi. WK Construction is already the preferred engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner for Tembo Power’s 14.7 MW Kaptis project, a run-of-river hydropower project near the town of Kakamega, in western Kenya. In addition, WK Power, the investment arm of WK Construction, has taken an equity position in the $44-million project. The agreement for the Burundi projects also grants WK Construction preferred EPC contractor status, while WK Power will retain minority equity stakes in the projects. Tembo Power founder Raphael Khalifa says the projects are on track to reach financial close in the third quarter of 2021 and the combined investment will be about $50-million. Based in Mauritius, Tembo Power is currently raising equity financing for a portfolio of 10 projects, totalling 184 MW, across Kenya, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Dama and Siguvyaye projects are currently in the permitting phase. Aurecon, a leading South African engineering firm and a strategic technical partner of Tembo Power, has conducted the feasibility studies, including geotechnical and geophysical surveys. Trinity LLP is advising Tembo Power on the legal aspects to finance the projects according to international project financing standards. “At WK we are excited to be extending our partnership with Tembo and expanding the footprint of hydropower projects that we are involved with in East Africa. These projects add to our existing projects in Uganda and Kenya,” WK Construction CEO Karl Kusel said in a statement.
