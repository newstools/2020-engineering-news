The Kenyan government announced on Monday that it was going to re-open the country’s commercial aviation sector and allow the resumption of both domestic and international flights, Logistics Update Africa has reported. Domestic flights will restart on Wednesday (July 15) and international flights will resume on August 1. This was announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta in an address to the nation. Kenya had halted all international passenger flights in March, except for repatriation flights. In May, domestic flights were also suspended. Cargo flights were exempted from these bans. “As air operators, we have put in place measures that will enable passengers to fly safely,” assured Kenya Association of Air Operators executive secretary Colonel (retired) EK Waithaka. Logistics Update Africa noted that the resumption of commercial air transport would be welcome news to the country’s national flag carrier, Kenya Airways. The airline has been in financial difficulties for some years. The aviation shutdown, to counter the Covid-19 pandemic, had exacerbated its situation. During the shutdown, it had focused on cargo and repatriation flights. “From a Kenya Airways point of view, we all want to go as soon as possible,” affirmed Kenya Airways board chairperson Michael Joseph. “If we could fly tomorrow, we could fly tomorrow. We need to fly, the country needs us to fly, and the business needs us to fly.” An internal memo written by Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka and dated July 3 stated that the carrier had, owing to the shutdown, lost revenues of about $100-million. The memo had further stated that the airline was going to have to cut jobs, routes and assets.
