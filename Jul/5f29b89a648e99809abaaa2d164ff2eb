JSE-listed diversified real estate investment trust Redefine Properties has appointed Diane Radley as an independent nonexecutive director. The appointment is in line with Redefine’s stated intention of strengthening governance and board independence, broadening diversity and bolstering skills on its board, it said. A qualified chartered accountant, Radley is an alumnus of Rhodes University and holds an MBA from the Wits Business School, as well as an AMP from Harvard. She has international experience both in her executive capacity and as a nonexecutive director. Radley was previously a nonexecutive director at Old Mutual Real Estate Holding Company. “We are delighted to welcome Diane to the board and look forward to working with her. Given her broad investment, real estate and board experience, she will be an invaluable resource as we continue to execute our strategy in a particularly challenging environment,” commented Redefine chairperson Sipho Pityana. Redefine’s gender diversity policy promotes a voluntary target of 40% female representation on the board over a three-year period, while the racial diversity policy promotes a voluntary target of 50% black representation on the board over the same period. Radley’s appointment takes Redefine’s female representation on the board to 60%. “Diane’s appointment furthers our efforts to benefit from fresh and diverse perspectives from our independent directors,” noted Pityana.
