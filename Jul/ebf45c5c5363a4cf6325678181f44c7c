Pet food manufacturer Montego Pet Nutrition's R22-million investment in a dedicated solar energy plant last year is yielding returns. Marketing manager Wilfred Cawood says that, as a result, the company's carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by 300 t to date this year. "The Graaff-Reinet-based production facility benefits from the favourable climate conditions overlying the homegrown Karoo town, at a time when solar energy presents a viable solution to the growing energy demand and strain on South Africa power grid," he says. “Montego is committed to becoming a low-carbon company and sustaining the environment. We take our responsibility of establishing renewable energy sources in our business seriously, particularly as this relates to the local context and the challenging state of South Africa's utility infrastructure.” The company completed work on the 843 kW solar panel system, spanning 4 580 m2 of rooftop space, in May 2019. The nine-month project followed closely on a R70-million factory upgrade in 2018 to meet local and international demand for its premium quality pet food, which boosted overall production by 30%. “The boost in production and demand for Montego’s pet food and treats meant that a move to renewable energy sources was crucial for us. Not only do we believe it to be our responsibility to sustaining the environment, but solar energy also presented attractive cost efficiencies from a business standpoint,” Cawood points out.
