President Cyril Ramaphosa on July 3 said coronavirus forums would be rolled out nationwide and commended the Mpumalanga province for establishing the first such forums. “I commend the Mpumalanga province for establishing coronavirus forums. It is a new approach and it is fantastic coming from the province of the rising sun. It is good to hear that you are also moving forward in establishing coronavirus forums because it is through these forums that we are able to inculcate the approach and the discipline of behaviour change and I commend you for that approach and we will be propagating this strategy countrywide, that we should all establish coronavirus forums where people can have discussions about this virus and how it is manifesting itself in our country," he commented on a visit to the province. He was accompanied by Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Ramaphosa said a raging issue was the intolerance of those who may be affected by Covid-19. “The stigmatisation where people now begin to fear and avoid being in the same vicinity with people who are known to have contracted it and recovered must end. We cannot move forward with the level of intolerance being displayed by some within our nation.” said the President. He further said the province needed to find a strategy of dealing with hotspots of Covid-19 infections. “I am glad that your strategy identifies that you need a strategy for hotspots; your focus . . . here is impressive and admirable,” said the President.
