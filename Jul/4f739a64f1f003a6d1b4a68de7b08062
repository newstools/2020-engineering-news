JSE-listed MTN expects to post a triple-digit climb in earnings for the six months ended June 30. The telecommunications group anticipates earnings per share (EPS) to be more than 592c for the six months under review, a rise of 345c, or 140%, on the 247c reported in the corresponding six months last year. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months to June areÂ expected to be at least 195c, or 100%, higher, at 390c, than the HEPS of 195c in the first half of 2019. EPS includes the benefit from gains amounting to 341c on the disposal, in March, of the ATC Uganda and ATC Ghana tower joint ventures, while HEPS benefited from nonoperational items amounting to 50c apiece, of which more than half related to foreign exchange gains. MTN, which is currently in the process of finalising its results for the six months ended June, will provide a further update on the expected EPS and HEPS growth ranges once it has reasonable certainty of the ranges.
