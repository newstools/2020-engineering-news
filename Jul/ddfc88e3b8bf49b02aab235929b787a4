Peugeot (Groupe PSA) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) have announced the corporate name of the new group as they move toward the completion of a 50:50 merger as defined in the combination agreement announced on December 18, last year. The corporate name of the new auto maker will be Stellantis. The name is rooted in the Latin verb “stello”, meaning “to brighten with stars”. The name’s Latin origins pay tribute to the history of the founding French, Italian and American companies, while the evocation of astronomy captures the spirit of optimism, energy and renewal driving this industry-changing merger, say the two companies in a press release. The process of identifying the new name began soon after the combination agreement was announced and the senior management of both companies have been closely involved throughout.

The Stellantis name will be used exclusively at the group level as a corporate brand, notes the release. The next step in the process will be the unveiling of a logo that, with the name, will become the corporate brand identity. The names and the logos of the Stellantis group’s constituent brands will remain unchanged. Completion of the merger project is expected in the first quarter of next year, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by both companies’ shareholders at their respective extraordinary general meetings and the satisfaction of antitrust and other regulatory requirements. Peugeot Citroën South Africa (PCSA) says it has no comment on the merger, except that, at the moment, there are no changes to its operations in South Africa. Both FCA and PCSA are present in South Africa with their own corporate structures and dealership networks. Groupe PSA is also the owner of the German Opel brand, but Opel does not fall under PCSA in the South African market.
