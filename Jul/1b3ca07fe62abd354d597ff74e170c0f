Transnet Group CE Portia Derby on July 27 met with the leadership of various community organisations in Saldanha Bay, to address challenges in the port town that have led to protests in the area. The meetings were part of her engagement with stakeholders on the west coast, including the Saldanha Bay Industrial Development Zone and the local municipality, to strengthen collaboration between Transnet and the broader Saldanha Bay community. The issues raised by the community forums include challenges with Transnet's procurement processes, the employment practices of Transnet suppliers and service providers and the development and upskilling of communities in Saldanha Bay. Derby has committed that Transnet will provide an update on the steps taken by the group to address the issues raised in three months.
