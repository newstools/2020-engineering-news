In this working paper, research organisation Trade & Industrial Policy Strategies discusses the need for South Africa to deal with the country's water and sanitation challenges while stimulating the economy. As South Africa responds to Covid-19 and aims to stimulate the economy and job creation post the lockdown through an infrastructure-led package, an opportunity should not be missed to address many of the water and sanitation challenges in the country. This is much needed and would provide multiple benefits, not only for the economy but also for poor communities that need the infrastructure and services as well as municipalities that require strengthening of their water and wastewater infrastructure. This policy brief looks at the benefits of including water and sanitation in the country’s stimulus package and considers possible avenues to do so.
