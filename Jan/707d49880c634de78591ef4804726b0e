Eskom has warned that it will disconnect supply to Westrand Power Distributors owing to unpaid bills amounting to over R18-million. The power disconnection would affect areas such as Krugersdorp, Roodepoort, Randfontein and Riverlea. In a statement issued on Thursday, Eskom senior manager for customer service, Daphne Mokwena, urged all affected parties to express their objection or support for the utility's intention to disconnect the supply on February 20, 2020, as it will affect the mining community of Westvillage. According to the statement, the planned disconnection was communicated on December 24, 2019. Eskom has advised that representations and/or submissions were due "by no later than close of business on January 24, 2020 as a final decision will be made on February 4, 2020, after all submissions have been considered", said Mokwena. Mokwena also said Eskom has not receivedÂ any representation, submission, presentation or comments on why it should or should not go ahead with its contemplated plan. "If we do not receive any form of submission from affected parties, we will continue with the planned disconnection on February 20, 2020," she said.
