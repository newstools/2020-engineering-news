Eskom will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 21:00 on Thursday until 06:00 on Friday due to depleting emergency resources, the power utility said in a statement on Thursday afternoon. "We have been using pumped storage schemes and open cycle gas turbines extensively over the past few days in order to supplement capacity, and we need to replenish these overnight," it said. "The risk of stage 2 load-shedding remains for tomorrow (Friday) into the weekend, but we will review the status of the system and communicate tomorrow morning." Unplanned outages were slightly reduced at 12 683 MW as at 13:30, against the utility's goal of 9 500MW.
