Anheuser Busch InBev’s Felipe Dutra may step down after about 15 years as CFO of the world’s largest brewer, a person familiar with the matter said. Succession planning is routine for officials at his level, according to the person, who asked to remain anonymous as the information isn’t public. Timing of the change isn’t known and Nelson Jamel, the company’s financial head for North America, is one of a number of people under consideration as a replacement, the person said. AB InBev has disappointed investors as CEO Carlos Brito reported earnings below analysts’ estimates in four of the past eight quarters. Brito halved the brewer’s dividend payout in 2018 amid sluggish progress on debt reduction following the acquisition of SABMiller in 2016, although moves such as the disposal of the Asian business are aimed at cutting borrowings. The shares fell as much as 1% in Brussels Wednesday. The Financial Times reported earlier that AB InBev was considering replacing Dutra. A company representative declined to comment. A call to Dutra’s office after business hours wasn’t answered.
