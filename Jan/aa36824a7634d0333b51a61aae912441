Property developer Atterbury on Wednesday handed over a new R150-million purpose-built showroom to car resale specialist WeBuyCars, in the Western Cape. The dealership development comprises 13 500 m2 of car floor space, which is able to accommodate about 700 cars, and 800 m2 of office space. Atterbury had ten months to complete the development from conception to occupation. Construction on the showroom started in June 2019 and WeBuyCars hosted the opening of the showroom on December 1. To meet the tight schedule, Atterbury brought contractor Stabilid Cape on board earlier than usual in the development process, before construction began. The company said in-depth pre-planning by the team, which included project architect Boogertman + Partners, helped flag and remove potential snags to avoid delays in completion. “Designed to offer customers an excellent experience while putting them in the drivers’ seat, the bright, airy WeBuyCars showroom uses generous natural light to showcase the gleaming cars to maximum effect,” the property developer stated. Another advantage is the showroom’s accessible location in Cape Town’s rapidly growing northern suburbs. It is conveniently positioned for car sellers and buyers from across the region and beyond. This landmark development for WeBuyCars adds to Atterbury’s record of delivering purpose-built car showrooms for various dealerships, including BMW and Joburg City Ford in Johannesburg’s recently revitalised Newtown. The development also adds to Atterbury’s list of successful projects in the Western Cape, including the Citadel development, in Claremont, and project oversight of the Waterway House at the V&A Waterfront. Atterbury’s latest mixed-use projects in the Western Cape include the development of Richmond Park, the prime business site on the N7 corridor, as well as King Air Industria adjacent to Cape Town International Airport.
