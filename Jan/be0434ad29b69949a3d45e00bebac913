Ogilvy South Africa outgoing CEO Alistair Mokoena is preparing to take on the role of country director at Google South Africa from April 2020, succeeding former CEO Luke McKend, who left the firm in November 2018. Mokoena will oversee the commercial business for Google South Africa. “Google is working hard to bring more Africans online, to unlock economic opportunities through working with local communities and to make our products more helpful to Africans in the African continent. Mokoena’s knowledge and expertise will be key to helping us deliver on these goals in the local market,” says Google Africa director Nitin Gajria. Mokoena, who was previously MD, and then CEO, of Ogilvy South Africa, has also worked at Absa, South African Breweries, Tiger Brands, Unilever and Mondelez; is chairperson of the Interactive Advertising Bureau; and has been appointed Professor of Practice by the Johannesburg Business School. He holds an LLB from Rhodes University, an MBA from Mancosa and is working towards obtaining a PhD from the North West University School of Business this year. “The digital economy presents many challenges and opportunities – particularly in developing markets like South Africa’s. Technology is mainstream and the online, digital world is no longer a challenger to the offline world,” says Mokoena. “I am looking forward to joining Google South Africa, which is well-positioned to help South African organisations navigate a rapidly changing landscape as the online and offline worlds converge.”
