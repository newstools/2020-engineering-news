Renewable energy developer Enel Green Power (EGP) set a new record in 2019 by building about 3 029 MW of new renewables capacity globally. This new capacity was set to generate around 9.3 TWh/y, avoiding the emission of 5.85-million tons of carbon dioxide a year into the atmosphere, contributing to the Enel group’s goal of generating about 57% of its production from renewable sources by 2022. CEO Antonio Cammisecra says the achievement has set a new benchmark for the renewables sector. He adds that the company will continue to challenge itself to set new records, in line with its 2020 to 2022 Strategic Plan, which envisages a yearly average new capacity addition of 4.7 GW over the period. This will amount to a total addition of 14.1 GW over the period, to reach a total managed capacity of 60 GW by 2022. EPG had about 46 MW of total capacity at the end of 2019. The renewable capacity built by EPG in 2019 comprised 47 facilities, of which 1 813 MW was wind capacity and 1 193 MW solar capacity. These facilities were mainly distributed across Spain, Mexico, the US, Oceania and South Africa.
