Two units at the Hwange thermal power station have been returned to service after flooding occurred on January 18 and caused the power station to be forcibly shut, the Zimbabwe Power Company said. “Units 1 and 4 returned to service this morning, while unit 2 is expected back in service by day end,” the Zimbabwe Power Company said in an emailed statement. The Hwange power plant was producing 64 MW on Monday, according to the utility. It has an installed capacity of 920 MW. The plant was knocked off line with the loss of 400 MW because of local flooding. The Southern African nation has been experiencing power cuts lasting as long as 18-hours a day, with output at its hydro power station in Kariba constrained because of a regional drought.
