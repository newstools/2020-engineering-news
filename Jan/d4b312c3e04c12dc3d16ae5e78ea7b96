National Treasury has published the Municipal Fiscal Powers and Functions Amendment Bill for public comment. Interested parties will have until March 13 to submit their comments. Treasury will also host national and provincial workshops to provide technical clarity on the provisions of the Amendment Bill in coming weeks. The Bill provides for a uniform regulation of development charges, which are a one-off charge levied by a municipality on a land owner as a condition for approving a land development application. The charges are imposed to cover the costs incurred by the municipality when it installs new infrastructure or upgrades existing infrastructure that is required to service the proposed development. “The Bill establishes an unambiguous, fair and consistent basis for municipalities to recover development charges for all new land development projects that require statutory approvals through the municipal land use planning system. “The aim of the Amendment Bill is to increase the amount and the predictability of development charge revenue, to provide both municipalities and developers with more certainty and assurance that the costs of infrastructure are covered by its users. “The incidence of the payment is also immediately apparent as the land owner pays and, to the extent that the market permits, the land owner will pass on these costs to the purchaser of the property that is sold,” Treasury explains. Treasury further highlights that the development charges ensure that infrastructure required to service new developments is paid by direct beneficiaries, so that existing residents do not subsidise new developments.
