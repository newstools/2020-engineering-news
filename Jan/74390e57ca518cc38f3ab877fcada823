Telecommunications, enterprise and consumer technology solutions provider ZTE Corporation and telecommunications group MTN Uganda have teamed up to launch the first fifth-generation (5G) service in Uganda. The parties showcased a high-speed 5G network under the 60 MHz spectrum bandwidth with an actual rate of more than 1.494 GB/s. The first 5G network in East Africa can support typical 5G applications such as ultrareliable low-latency communication and massive machine-type communication. This supports Gigabit without Fibre Connectivity, Cloud extended reality, ultrahigh-definition live broadcast, automatic driving and remote surgery. The network deployment and operation adopts ZTE's end-to-end 5G equipment, including common core, to achieve the complete separation of the signalling plane and the data plane without relying on the existing long-term evolution core / evolved packet core network. “The demonstration also featured the real-time communication of an on-site fixed-wireless access network, bionic robot, Cloud Virtual Reality and other vertical industries, fully showcasing the 5G network's capability as the foundation of an intelligent society, as well as ZTE and MTN's commitment to exploring 5G development in Africa,” the parties said in a statement on Tuesday. In addition, ZTE also presented its end-to-end commercialised 5G solutions, including the Beyond 100G Transmission, 5G Flexhaul, 5G New Radio and Big Video, as well as its 5G terminal devices, such as Axon 10 Pro 5G smartphones, 5G indoor and outdoor routers. “ZTE is keen on sharing new technologies with MTN. We have been constantly enhancing our 5G capabilities and have become a core supplier of end-to-end solutions in the global information and communications technology industry,” said ZTE VP Bill Yi.
