Infrastructure provider Openserve has been hit by reduced speed on international browsing, with international voice calling and mobile roaming also impacted, after an “unusual” dual cable break on the submarine systems connecting South Africa to Europe. The West Africa Cable System (WACS) and South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC) consortiums for the Atlantic Ocean cable systems are working to determine the loss of service on both submarine cable systems. “Through continuous liaison with the technical fault investigation teams of both cable consortiums, Openserve has ascertained that the SAT3/WASC break is in the Libreville, Gabon, vicinity and that the WACS break point is in the vicinity of Luanda, Angola,” Openserve explained in a statement. The WACS system lands in South Africa at Yzerfontein, while the SAT3/WASC system enters South Africa at Melkbosstrand, both in the Western Cape. “Openserve assures its clients and their respective customers that constant interface with the consortiums and their original-equipment manufacturer partners will continue until both cable systems are up and running again.” Openserve said it has offered assistance and resources wherever possible to both consortiums.
