Mini South Africa, part of the BMW Group South Africa, aims to launch a pilot car-sharing scheme in Sandton, Johannesburg, in the third quarter of this year. Participants will be able to use the participating cars with “just a few taps on their smartphones”, says the car maker. “Mini drivers are always ahead of their time and, with Mini Sharing, we will enable a group of Mini fans to participate in the burgeoning sharing economy in this country," notes Mini South Africa head Shaun Willis. "Mini is taking on a pioneering and innovative role in advancing urban mobility in South Africa. Mini Sharing creates new opportunities to share the Mini experience and this technology fits perfectly with our desirable cars and our innovative customer demographic.” Initially, Mini Sharing will be available to a closed group of users, although plans are afoot to expand the offering to other quintessentially urban locations within South Africa. Mini Sharing allows Mini vehicle owners to share their vehicle with up to ten people of their choosing, with vehicle availability highlighted in the Mini Sharing app’s inbuilt calendar function. The guest drivers can use the app to make a reservation request from their smartphone with just a few taps. Broader speaking, typical car-sharing schemes active in a number of global cities generally refer to the short-term ‘rental’ of participating vehicles for short-range driving. A smartphone app shows a potential customer to the nearest available parked car – the user can also book a car beforehand –with the same app allowing access to the car. The driver then uses the vehicle to drive to their destination, usually within a limited range, and leaves the vehicle for the next customer to find. ShareNow in Germany allows access to more than 6 300 cars, for example, with users paying a per minute fee. Car-sharing has, in some cities and for some customers, negated the need to own a car.
