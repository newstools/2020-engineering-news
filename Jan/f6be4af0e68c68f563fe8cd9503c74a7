Gauteng’s combined provincial water storage level has reached 99.2% this week – an improvement from 94.3% in the corresponding period the year before. The Integrated Vaal River System’s 14 major dams registered an aggregate level of 62.4%, which, while up from last week’s 61.9%, is lower than the 69.3% level recorded during the same period last year. “[The] Vaal dam is struggling to recover optimally as it sits at 50.6%, a sharp decline compared with 74.6% during the same period last year,” the Department of Water and Sanitation said in a statement on Thursday. Bronkhorstspruit dam, east of Pretoria, has shown stability from last week’s levels, maintaining a decent 94.6% this week. The dam stood at 91.3% in the same week last year. Rietvlei dam has remained at 100.6%, while Roodeplaat dam is stable at 100.4%. Despite the positive trend, some major dams in the province have not fully recovered and the department urges consumers to reduce water consumption.
