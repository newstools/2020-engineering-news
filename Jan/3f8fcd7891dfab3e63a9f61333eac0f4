End-to-end waste management company Averda has been awarded a three-year contract by steel producer ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) for the collection, transportation and disposal of several complex waste streams including sludge, coal tar, oil and grease, effluent, borax and phosphates, besides others, from AMSA’s operations in the Vaal Triangle. Averda will offer specialised equipment to ensure material recovery is maximised and non-recoverable material is efficiently and safely managed at the highest environmental standards. Owing to criticality, the project began a week earlier than planned, which required additional focus from the Averda South Africa team to prepare the equipment and manpower to ensure operational readiness from the beginning. This contract builds upon Averda’s national footprint in South Africa, providing end-to-end waste services, including on-site industrial cleaning and waste collection to a range of corporates and management of facilities both for treatment and disposal of numerous waste streams across the country. “This is an excellent win for Averda, demonstrating our ability to secure more technical waste service contracts with prestigious clients like AMSA and expand our market share across South Africa,” says Averda South Africa MD Johan van den Berg.
