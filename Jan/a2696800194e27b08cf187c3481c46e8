Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has committed to provide funding for drought relief efforts in the drought-stricken Eastern Cape. The province has been hard hit by severe drought conditions and has been declared a drought disaster area. Sisulu tasked Department of Water and Sanitation acting director-general Mbulelo Tshangana with sourcing the funds and prioritising the drought crisis following a formal support request from Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane. “The department is looking at working with the province and municipalities as a collective to find resolutions to the ongoing drought,” she said in a statement issued on Tuesday. This followed a meeting on Monday with the Eastern Cape executive council. The meeting, attended by Deputy Minister David Mahlobo and Deputy Minister Pamela Tshwete, served as a platform for drought mitigation engagements between the Ministry and the provincial executive council. The measures proposed include the drilling of boreholes, desalination and a long-term solution of desilting. “The department will also look at the installation of a pipeline that will take water from the Tsomo river to a water treatment plant in Ngqamakhwe, and finally move water to Butterworth,” she said. “In certain areas, the number of water tanks will be increased to meet the demand.” The department also met with water board Amatola Water to extend its mandate to address the lack of capacity in municipalities. Sisulu further urged cooperation between all spheres of government, communities and the private sector.
