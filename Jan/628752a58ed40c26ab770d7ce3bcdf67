Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula announced on Wednesday that the "war room" he set up inÂ August 2019 to turn around the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) would be wound down as many of its functions are being transferred to the State-owned entity's administrator. Mbalula placed Prasa under administration in early December. In a statement on Wednesday, Mbalula said that Prasa was a "broken organisation, struggling to provide an efficient commuter and passenger rail service". "The administrator is now in the process of facilitating an orderly winding down of the War Room, which would entail incorporating its targets into the work of the management under his leadership," he said in the statement. Mbalula explained that the war room was never intended to be a "silver bullet" to rid Prasa of its "chronic ailments". The minister said that although the war room had not met all of its targets, there was progress in improving operational performance at the rail agency. The war room also helped in "energising management" and mobilising staff behind a focused vision, he added. "Extending the mandate of the War Room beyond its original target of 31 December 2019 would have been counter-productive," Mbalula said.
