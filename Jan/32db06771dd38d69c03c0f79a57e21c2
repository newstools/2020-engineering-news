The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) on Monday announced that it had signed a service level agreement with Lejwe Le Putswa Development Agency (LDA), based in the Free State. CDC will use its expertise in project management and developing special economic zones to assist LDA in developing projects such as the Thabong industrial park, a driver training programme for young people and a waste-to-gas power generation project. The Thabong industrial park, specifically, is a R69-million project aimed at formalising 19 businesses that currently operate in the informal sector in the Lejwe Le Putswa district municipality. The industrial park will create employment opportunities for more than 160 people and improve opportunities for local communities. LDA CEO Bafunani Mnguni said in a statement that the district wants to diversify its economy from the shrinking mining and agricultural sectors. “Coega boasts more than 20 years of experience in the industrial and economic development projects. The organisation has sufficient expertise and competent personnel who can assist LDA on projects. “The CDC is looking forward to working with LDA. This is a step taken by both parties towards bringing in investors and enhancing the region’s investment attraction, particularly the Free State,” said CDC executive manager Bonginkosi Mthembu.
