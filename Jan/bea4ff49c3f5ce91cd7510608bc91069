Construction of the high-tech Johannesburg International Transport Interchange (JITI) – a 50 000 m² international long-distance and cross-border transport and shopping hub – is 85% complete. The Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) has been implementing the JITI on behalf of the City of Johannesburg. Construction initially started in July 2016 and, in May 2019, a new contractor was appointed to complete the project. The project will be handed over to the city’s Department of Transport when completed in May this year. With closed-circuit television cameras throughout the facility, good lighting and wide corridors, the JITI is designed to be safe and attractive, transforming long-distance and cross-border travel. The facility is expected to provide long-distance travellers with amenities to make departure and arrival a pleasant experience. It boats 3 300 m² of retail space for large retail outlets, banks, ticketing offices, food courts and informal traders. This is expected to create a variety of economic opportunities and provide social amenities for inner city users and residents. To negate the long wait by long-distance travellers for buses and taxis in the inner city, the facility features a bus terminal for cross-border buses, as well as ranking and holding space for 648 taxis; ranking space for 158 taxis and ranking for 20 buses. “The City of Johannesburg continues to experience an increase in demand for road space. “The state-of-the-art JITI will be one of the critical projects which will ensure that efficient mass public transport networks and connections, transit-orientated multi-use precincts, together with strategic land-use planning and zoning regimes, are realised so we connect our people to opportunities to live, work and play in the city,” says  Transport MMC Councillor Nonhlanhla Makhuba.
