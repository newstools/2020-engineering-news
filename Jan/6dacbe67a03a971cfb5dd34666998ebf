Icon Earthworks, part of the Icon Group, is on track to complete the demolition of a number of older buildings to make way for the expansion of the Melrose Arch precinct. The R2.5-million contract for the demolition of four buildings was awarded to Icon Group by Amdec Property Developments at the end of November for completion in March. Icon is the principal contractor for the demolition, safety and community management for the project. The contract includes the demolition and removal from site of four multistorey apartment blocks situated in the densely populated area of Corlett drive. The buildings being demolished are up to 50 years old and the form and function of these buildings are at odds with modern trends and lifestyles, Icon Group indicated. The area that is being demolished is making way for a super basement under Melrose Arch, as well as the construction of a mixed-use building on the site. Icon Group MD Wayne Neary highlighted the use of sustainable construction practices on the project, with all of the building material salvaged from this site to be crushed as aggregate to be used on another site.
