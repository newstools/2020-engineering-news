State-owned national flag-carrier South African Airways (SAA) has been ranked as the number one African airline with regard to on-time performance (OTP), it reported on Tuesday. The ranking was done by Cirium, a travel data and analytics business. According to the International Air Transport Association, OTP is defined as meaning that an airliner leaves within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure time and arrives within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival time. African airlines were grouped together with Middle East airlines, and, when the Middle Eastern carriers were taken into account, SAA ranked fourth in the combined category. SAA’s OTP was rated at 85.69%. “We are encouraged by this latest announcement about our performance,” said SAA acting CEO Zuks Ramasia. “It is an endorsement and occasion to celebrate great achievement, especially when judged against our peers, globally. Customers always have a choice and those who elect to fly with us recognise that we are a dependable airline.” “We place a high premium on punctuality as OTP,” she added. “It is one of our most important customer impact performance indicators. The more punctual we are, the happier the customers we keep. Any flight delays could lead to costs for the airline and inconvenience to the customer.” Cirium, which works with most of the world’s top 50 airlines, has published its OTP Review for 11 years. “When choosing whom to fly with, savvy travellers also now consider airline punctuality and operational reliability,” affirmed Cirium CEO Jeremy Bowen. SAA flies to eight intercontinental destinations and is a member of the Star Alliance international airline network. Within South Africa and Africa, it flies to 57 destinations, in partnership with low-cost carrier Mango (part of the SAA group), State-owned regional airline SA Express and private-sector airline Airlink.
