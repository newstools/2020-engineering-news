State-owned power utility Eskom foresees a high likelihood of implementing Stage 2 load-shedding again on Wednesday evening to replenish water resources for its pumped storage schemes and minimise the use of diesel at the open-cycle gas turbines. This follows after the utility terminated Stage 2 load-shedding on Wednesday morning. “The power system remains vulnerable. While we were able to replenish water levels at the pumped storage schemes overnight, we are currently using these emergency resources, including diesel, to meet demand [on Wednesday]. “In the event that we lose other generation units or are unable to bring back those that were out for maintenance, load-shedding may be implemented earlier in the day,” Eskom said.
