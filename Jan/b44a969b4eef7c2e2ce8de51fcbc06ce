The remaining board members at troubled South African State nuclear company Necsa have resigned, the energy ministry said on Wednesday, adding that officials would prioritise new appointments to the board. Necsa is one of the world's largest producers of medical radioisotopes and promotes research and development in nuclear energy. But it has been mired in a financial and operational crisis, like other state-run firms including power utility Eskom.
