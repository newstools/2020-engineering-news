Parliament's defence and military veterans portfolio committee has welcomed the investigation into the cause of the South African Air Force (SAAF) aircraft crash at Goma airport in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, January 9. The SAAF Lockheed C-130BZ Hercules aircraft, which reportedly carried 67 people including members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), was on its way back from the City of Beni where logistical support was provided to the SANDF members deployed in United Nations' mission in the region. According to media reports, one of the left engines caught fire during the landing. “We are relieved that no one was injured during the crash, but we need a full report on what went wrong and ensure that there are measures in place to prevent the recurrence of such incidents,” committee chairperson Cyril Xaba said in a statement on Sunday. The defence industry was under severe pressure and the SANDF was not in a position to lose strategic assets because of the country’s fiscal problems. The committee would, during the next parliamentary session, invite the defence department for a briefing on the details of the crash and the measures that were put in place, Xaba said.
