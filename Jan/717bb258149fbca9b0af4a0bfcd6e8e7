While the dam levels in the Western Cape recorded a marginal year-on-year climb, continued early weather predictions for this year indicate the season ahead may not see the rainfall that is needed in all regions. At the start of 2020, the Western Cape’s dam levels climbed slightly to 53.9%, from the recorded levels of 51.2% in the corresponding period last year. However, Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell urges communities across the province to use water responsibly. “We need to permanently reduce our water use as the resource is finite and demand keeps increasing,” he says, noting that the province continues to monitor and provide support to areas where extreme drought continues. “We continue to be most concerned about the Karoo region of the province where the Gouritz river catchment sees average dam levels of only 15.5% at the moment, despite recent rainfall in the region.” The area continues to rely largely on groundwater for drinking and presently all communities still have sufficient drinking water. “Farmers in those regions continue to be most affected and we urge them to contact the provincial department of agriculture for assistance,” he concludes.
