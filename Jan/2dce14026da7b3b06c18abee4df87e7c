From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: ICON Earthworks, part of the ICON Group, has been awarded a R2.5-million contract for the demolition of four buildings by property development company Amdec. Mc’Kyla Nortje has the story. Mc’Kyla Nortje: The contract includes the demolition and removal from site of four multi-story apartment blocks situated in the densely populated area of Corlett Drive, in Johannesburg. The buildings being demolished are about 50 years old and the form and function of these buildings have not kept pace with modern trends and lifestyles. Icon Group MD Wayne Neary tells us more. Icon Group MD Wayne Neary: Mc’Kyla Nortje: The demolished area will allow for the expansion of the Melrose Arch Precinct, which will include a super basement under Melrose Arch, as well as the construction of a mixed-use building – which will include offices, showrooms and luxury apartments. Icon Group MD Wayne Neary: Mc’Kyla Nortje: Neary explains that traditionally, rubble from this type of demolition is spoilt into a landfill or dump sites. However, with this project ICON Group is providing Amdec with double sustainability savings through the re-use of the crushed aggregate. ICON Group’s latest hammers and crushers will be used for this purpose. Icon Group MD Wayne Neary: Mc’Kyla Nortje: Neary notes that ICON Group is currently involved with a number of other projects in Riversands and Sunderland ridge, in Johannesburg, and which are expected to reach completion early this year.
