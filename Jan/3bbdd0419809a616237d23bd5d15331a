Female matriculants have bagged 63.8% of distinctions from the 2019 matric class, with their male counterparts garnering 36.2% of distinctions. As a result, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says more female candidates are eligible for studies at higher education institutions. The matric class of 2019 achieved an 81.3% pass rate, up from 78.2% in 2018. Female matriculants garnered a collective 156 884 distinctions in critical subjects including Accounting, Business Studies, Economics, Mathematics and Physical Science. “This means that we are systematically addressing all imperatives related to the social justice principles, especially equity and redress,” Motshekga said. She applauded the benefits of the ‘pro-poor’ policies of government and revealed passes for quintiles 1 to 3, or no fee, schools combined, stood at 248 960. No fee school learners achieved 96 922 Bachelor passes – an increase of 14.4% from 2018. “The poignancy of this increase lies in what research tells us, that in 2005, 60% of the Bachelor passes came from the best performing 20% of the schooling system.  However, with the introduction of a pro-poor financing of the education system, in 2015, no fee schools produced 51% of the Bachelor passes, which increased to 55% in 2019. Therefore, the significance of this, is that the gap between the Bachelor passes produced by no fee schools versus those produced by fee paying schools has significantly and progressively increased from 2% in 2015, to 10% in 2019.  This is remarkable indeed!” she exclaimed. She congratulated the class of 2019, wishing them well and thanking principals, teachers, and parents for their roles.
