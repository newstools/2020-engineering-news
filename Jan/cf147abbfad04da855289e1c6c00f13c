JSE-listed information technology services company EOH has appointed lead independent nonexecutive director Andrew Mthembu interim chairperson, following the passing of Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi on Saturday. The company in a statement on Monday said Mkhwanazi had been admitted to the Wits Donald Gordan Medical Centre, in Johannesburg, on December 14. He had served as chairperson from June 5 last year. The company stated that he had brought tremendous credibility and insight to the company at a difficult time for the organisation. “I worked closely with Dr Mkhwanazi who played a pivotal role in helping to guide EOH towards a better future. Dr Mkhwanazi led the board deliberations on all group matters, but most notably during the tough deliberations around the findings of the ENSafrica investigation commissioned by EOH into public sector contracts. “During this period, Dr Mkhwanazi braved a difficult time always striving to do the right thing. He grasped the issues and dealt with them quickly. He will be sorely missed,” commented EOH CEO Stephen van Coller. Mkhwanazi had been a nonexecutive director at diversified miner South32, while he also served as director at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and construction company Murray & Roberts (M&R), which extended their condolences in statements on Monday. PIC said the passing of Mkhwanazi had come at a critical time for PIC, since the organization had been hard at work to restore its reputation. Mkhwanazi had been re-appointed to the PIC board in July last year, alongside other board members to assist with this process. "His experience and skills would no doubt have been valuable during this transitional period." The Minerals Council South Africa also extended its "deepest condolences" to Mkhwanazi's family, friends and colleagues.
