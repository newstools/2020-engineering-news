Eskom on Wednesday warned that there is a high likelihood stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented in the evening. The power utility issued an update on Twitter indicating that it ceased overnight load-shedding at 06:00, but more load-shedding may be required later to "replenish water resources for its pumped storage systems and minimise the use of diesel at open cycle gas turbines." Plant breakdowns were at 13 471 MW at 06:00 on Wednesday. "The power system remains vulnerable. While we were able to replenish water levels at the pumped storage schemes overnight we are currently using these emergency resources including diesel to meet demand today," Eskom said. "In the event we lose other generation units or are unable to bring back those that were out for maintenance, load-shedding may be implemented earlier in the day," the power utility warned.
