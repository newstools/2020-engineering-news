Heavy lifting and transport company Mammoet has completed its acquisition of heavy lifting and transport specialist ALE, which will now operate under the Mammoet brand. Mammoet signed an agreement to acquire ALE on July 25 last year. Over the coming months, a fully developed integration plan will be rolled out that will focus on bringing the two organisations together, while maintaining “safe and world-class service to all customers,” Mammoet said in a statement on Wednesday. Commenting on the acquistion, Mammoet CEO Paul van Gelder said the company would support ALE with its activities. The combined businesses have more than 140 offices and branches globally. ALE employees have also been included into Mammoet’s board and the combined team “enhances scalability, innovation capabilities and efficient mobilisation”. The new board now comprises Van Gelder, CFO Kees Voormolen, CCO Michael Birch, COO Jan Kleijn and chief human resources officer Ivonne Verlinde.
