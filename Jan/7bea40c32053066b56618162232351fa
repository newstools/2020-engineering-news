Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has promised immediate interventions to address the extensive and prolonged water challenges in QwaQwa, in the Free State. Several initiatives were tabled for immediate action, with Sisulu planning to assess the progress within six weeks. Sedibeng Water, which has been appointed implementing agent with regard to all issues related to water challenges, will establish a war room and a steering committee to assess and monitor the progress made. The National Rapid Response Task Team will also form part of this process and will monitor it. “An amount of R220-million will be ring-fenced to address the immediate challenge in addition to the R280-million allocated to Sedibeng Water. This supports the proclamation to be made by the Premier with regard to drought in the area,” Sisulu said in a statement. In addition, 5 000 Jojo Tanks will be provided in the area within the next seven days to help with water harvesting and ensure all households have Jojo Tanks. Further, new technology will be explored to look at various aspects that will assist in addressing water challenges across the province, and Sedibeng Water will also look for residents who have the necessary skills and or technology to come forward as part of the intervention. A hotline will be established to deal with all immediate challenges related to water in the area. Water tankering will no longer be done by the municipality. “Sedibeng Water will ensure that all those trucks are assessed and they are bought from the owners so that the function is taken over from them,” she continued. “For the long term, there is a consideration of a pipeline which will cost in the region of R2.1-billion linking the municipality with Sterkfontein dam. Sedibeng Water will do a feasibility study to ensure the realisation of this plan,” Sisulu said.
