A London arbitration court has ordered Djibouti to restore DP World's right to operate the Doraleh Container Terminal as detailed under a 2006 concession deal within two months or pay damages, the State news agency WAM reported on Tuesday. The government of Djibouti seized the terminal from Dubai government-controlled DP World in February 2018 over a dispute dating back to at least 2012. An independent expert has estimated the losses to DP World at more than $1-billion, WAM reported.
