The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), which represents about 306 000 employees at automotive components companies, petrol stations and car dealerships, has signed a three-year wage agreement. Under the terms of the wage agreement, Numsa members employed by component manufacturers will receive a 7.5% increase for the first year and increases of 7% for the second and third years of the agreement. All other motor industries sector workers, excluding component manufacturers, will receive a 6% increase for the first year and increases of 5.5% for the second and third years. “We have also settled on an increase for the standby, tool-out and call-out allowance of 6% for the first year, and a 5.5% increase for the second and third years respectively,” Numsa says. Garage workers’ and car dealerships workers’ wages will increase by 8% for the first year and by 7% in the second and third years, respectively. “This round of wage talks was extremely tough because of the challenges faced in the economy. Despite this, we managed to secure higher wages, in particular for garage workers, who are the lowest paid in the sector. “We want to thank our officials for working tirelessly to secure these increases and we urge them to continue to serve our members to the best of their abilities,” the union comments.
