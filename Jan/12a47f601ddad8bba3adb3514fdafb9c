JSE-listed Tiger Brands has appointed Pamela Padayachee interim CFO, effective February 1. This follows the resignation earlier this week of CEO Lawrence MacDougall and the appointment of CFO Noel Doyle to the role of acting CEO. Padayachee will serve as interim CFO until a permanent appointment is made, which Tiger Brands expects will take at least four to six months. Padayachee joined the group as FD for the culinary fruit and vegetables business in 2016. Prior to her appointment as interim CFO, she served as FD for the groceries and consumer brands division.
