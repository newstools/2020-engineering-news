The Renewable Energy Project Development Office (Repdo) of Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Energy has issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) for round three of the Kingdom’s National Renewable Energy Program (NREP), which comprises four solar photovoltaic (PV) projects with a combined generation capacity of 1 200 MW. Round three projects will be divided into two categories. The first, Category A, targets smaller companies, and includes the 80 MW Layla and the 120 MW Wadi Al Dawaser solar PV projects. The second, Category B, includes the 300 MW Saad and the 700 MW Ar Rass solar PV projects. Repdo head Faisal Alyemni said on Thursday that the round three projects would carry a minimum requirement of 17% local content as calculated by the mechanisms defined by the Local Content & Government Procurement Authority. This authority aims to increase the value-added contribution of products and services in the national economy. Repdo was launched in 2017 and tendered the first round of renewable energy projects, which included the 300 MW Sakaka solar PV project, which is now connected to the national electricity grid. The 400 MW Dumat Al Jandal wind project is currently under construction. The second round of the NREP will comprise six solar PV projects with a combined capacity of 1 470 MW. The deadline for receiving proposals for round two projects will be on January 20 this year, and the deadline for categories B and A, will be February 3, respectively. The RFQ window for the round three projects closes on February 6, which is also the deadline for statement of qualifications submissions.
