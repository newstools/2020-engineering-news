Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom and communications infrastructure leader Zayo Group have partnered to leverage their existing networks for customers that have operations in Africa, Europe and North America. This partnership will see the duo add value for their customers through the use of each other’s network reach, as well as enable Zayo's customers, through Zayo’s self-service platform Tranzact, to tap into the extensive and reliable connectivity platform Liquid Telecom has built across the African continent. "We have long been committed to building Africa's digital future, and know that for African companies to be competitive, they have to be a part of the global digital economy,” said Liquid Telecom Group CEO Nic Rudnick. “This strategic partnership will assist many of our African customers who are looking to extend into operations beyond Africa, as well as those customers who already have operations in Europe and the US.” Zayo Group Europe MD Jesper Aagaard added that Zayo is committed to expanding its footprint, along with the ability to deliver bandwidth wherever and whenever customers require it. “We are excited to bring Zayo’s global reach to Africa, enabling access into key locations in North America and Europe. Our innovative Tranzact platform is a key tool for this access, as it integrates bandwidth into an online shopping experience, making purchasing and managing bandwidth easy to navigate and understand.”
