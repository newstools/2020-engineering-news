As part of government’s Covid-19 economic recovery strategy, more than 2 300 jobs will be created through the newly launched R292-million P714 road construction project, in KwaZulu-Natal. The construction of the road is expected to benefit the community of Ndwedwe, in the iLembe district municipality. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala was accompanied by Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Bheki Ntuli, as well as other local leaders to officially launch the project. The Premier said the construction of the road would connect the community of Ndwedwe to essential services such as schools, clinics, hospitals and public transport facilities. He also said that more than R84-million would benefit emerging local contractor companies owned by designated groups such as youth, women, people living with disability and military veterans. "The first 6 km of this road has been upgraded from gravel to tar. In total P714 spans 37.1 km and the estimated project value upon completion is R747-million. This road will improve agricultural trade, create connectivity to Ndwedwe and areas such uThongathi, Bhamshela and KwaMaphumulo," added Ntuli. “This massive development, which has been described as a game changer, will transform the lives of people in Ndwedwe and the Greater iLembe District, as it will unlock economic opportunities, see many jobs being created [and contribute to the] transfer of skills to emerging local contractors," he noted. Ntuli said a public-private partnership had been established with the Ndwedwe municipality for the contractor to build a community hall that would be used as a site office for the duration of the project. “After the project is completed, the hall will be cleaned, fenced and handed over to the municipality to be used by the community. Importantly, investment has been made in the development of women, youth and people living with disabilities through targeted training and skills development,” said Ntuli.
