Durban’s R2.2-billion automotive supplier park special economic zone will be operational in 2021, with automotive manufacturer Toyota as one of the agreed tenants. About 1 339 jobs will be created as a result of the investment, Economic Development, Tourism and Environment MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said during the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Ithala Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) and the South African Technicians Association (Sata). The MoU is aimed at fast-tracking the entry of disadvantaged communities into the automotive sector and entire value chain in the province. Dube-Ncube said that, as part of the revitalisation of the township economy, her department will be assisting emerging entrepreneurs involved in the automotive industry. “Undoubtedly, this is an area where jobs will be created to absorb thousands of people who lost their jobs during the lockdown. We want township-based young people, who are trained as artisans and mechanics to work in these repair automotive centres,” the MEC noted. “An automotive repair or service facility located in the city and suburbs has a jobs multiplier of 3.6. This means that for every one job at the facility, there are an additional 2.6 jobs supported in the local economy,” she added.
