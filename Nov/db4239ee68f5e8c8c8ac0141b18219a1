JSE-listed logistics group Grindrod’s marine safety and survival equipment subsidiary NovaMarine has been approved as an accredited service partner for CSM-branded safety equipment. NovaMarine can now offer a better service to ships that call into the ports of Durban and Cape Town. CSM has more than 200 international servicing stations and has now added NovaMarine to its service network, thanks to the company’s 55 years of experience, ideal location, multiskilled technicians and extensive client base. “The NovaMarine sales and operations team has been working relentlessly for the last three years to land this partnership. CSM survival equipment is internationally renowned and we need to partner with these brands to serve our customers' needs better. “Our customer service model revolves around service delivery and relationship-building, and we look forward to nurturing this partnership with CSM,” comments NovaMarine CEO Marcus Twine. Shanghai Star Rubber Products is the specialised manufacturer of the CSM brand of mine inflatable life rafts and other non-inflatable rubber products, which are approved by various classification societies. Twine says that, just days after the approval, NovaMarine has already received an order to service five life rafts. NovaMarine also extended its service offering earlier in the year to include a sanitising service for vessels, while it is also approved as a test station for gas cylinders. As CEO of both NovaMarine and ship repair and fabrication company Hesper Engineering, Twine explains that quite a few strategic internal changes were made within both companies in the last two years in a bid to better align with the marine industry’s needs.
