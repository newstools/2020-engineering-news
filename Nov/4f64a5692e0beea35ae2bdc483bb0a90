Sappi Dissolving Pulp has partnered with viscose manufacturer Birla Cellulose to provide a forest-to-garment traceability solution for brand owners. Through this collaborative partnership, its dissolving pulp brand, Sappi Verve, continues to strengthen its sustainability credentials within the textile industry. Providing a brand-owner traceability solution has been made possible with the use of Birla’s pioneering Green Track blockchain technology, coupled with Sappi’s comprehensive database on wood origin for its dissolving pulp operations in South Africa and the US, Sappi Verve notes. Sappi is committed to delivering practical innovations, building trust and creating shared value in its supply chain –  working closely with its partners to promote and shape the sustainability of the man-made cellulosic fibre sector towards a net positive vision, says Sappi Verve sustainability GM Krelyne Andrew. Traceable and transparent supply chains provide brand owners and consumers with the assurance that their products originate from sustainable and renewable sources of wood, free from deforestation, where biodiversity is promoted and where customary, traditional and civil rights of people are upheld, Sappi Verve states. “This collaboration is part of Sappi’s vision as a sustainable woodfibre business to provide relevant solutions and deliver enhanced value as a trusted partner to all its stakeholders,” says Andrew.
