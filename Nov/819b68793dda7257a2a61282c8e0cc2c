Japanese car marker Nissan has unveiled the spruced up Navara bakkie that will be made in South Africa and exported to sub-Saharan markets. Production of the new Navara at the Rosslyn plant, in Pretoria, will start in the first quarter of next year. Navara assembly will add to production of the NP200 and NP300 at the local facility, and will see the plant move to a second shift to accommodate the new model. Nissan’s Rosslyn facility will share global production of around 250 000 units a year with plants in Argentina, Thailand and Mexico. “For the first time in history the full model line-up of the next generation Navara will be produced on home soil,” says Nissan South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa MD Shinkichi Izumi. “I am immensely proud that we have overcome adversity and the effects of Covid-19 to reach this milestone and bring this amazing pickup to our plant in Rosslyn. “With this major R3-billion investment, Nissan is continuing to actively pursue the Nissan Next transformation plan in Africa, and this vehicle embodies our passion for excellence and our commitment to bring the very best products to our customers.” The new Navara line-up will see the introduction of the PRO-4X – a first for the Navara nameplate. “PRO-4X offers an even more impressive, eye-catching style to appeal to extreme adventure lovers who crave an escape from the daily routine. The new look of PRO-4X grade will be available across the global Nissan pickup line-up,” says Nissan.
