Audi South Africa has announced the appointment of Sascha Sauer as the new head of Audi Africa. He replaces Trevor Hill, who has taken up a position within the Audi Sport division abroad. In his previous role, Sauer was the sales director for the Africa and Middle/Near East region, based at Audi’s headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany. This means he has been closely involved in the Audi South Africa business for the past two years. Sauer, a German national, holds an MBA from Sheffield Hallam University and is a qualified mechanical engineer. He started his career with Audi in 1997. “Sascha brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience as well as a passion to develop and grow the Audi brand and business in South Africa,” says Volkswagen Group South Africa sales and marketing director Mike Glendinning. “Given his most recent role, he has a running start and a good understanding of the South African operations and the local Audi dealer network. He will provide good leadership to Audi South Africa and we look forward to welcoming him to his new home.” “I am looking forward to furthering the progress of the Audi brand in South Africa and working together with the internal Audi team and our dealer partners towards securing future readiness for the Audi business,” adds Sauer.
