Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) has celebrated the assembly of its four-millionth vehicle at its Uitenhage plant, in the Eastern Cape. The first of these vehicles was manufactured 72 years ago, in November 1948, when the premises still belonged to South African Motor Assemblers and Distributors. The first Volkswagen vehicle to be manufactured in Uitenhage was a Volkswagen Beetle that rolled off the production line in August, 1951. Since then, VWSA has produced a broad range of vehicles locally, such as various models of the Transporter series (Kombi), the Golf, Jetta and Polo. The Uitenhage plant currently manufactures the Polo for local and export markets, as well as the Polo Vivo for the local market. Since the start of 2020, the plant has produced 75 521 Polos for export markets, as well as 12 804 Polos and 17 038 Polo Vivos for the local market. “This production milestone is a proud moment for VWSA, and proof of the dedication of the VWSA family,” says VWSA acting production director Bernd Schaberg. “With this level of commitment, I am sure we can achieve many more milestones to come.”
