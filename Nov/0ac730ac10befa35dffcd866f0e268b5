Khwezi Tiya will join the Coega Development Corporation (CDC) as its new CEO, with effect from January 2021. Following the departure of Pepi Silinga as CEO, the CDC board undertook a recruitment process to source a suitable candidate to step into the role and lead the organisation in its quest to remain “the most successful special economic zone in the country”, as well as to steer it to its next level of success and recognition “as a force to be reckoned with” in South Africa, Africa and the rest of the world. In a statement on November 4, the CDC said Tiya has a “credible reputation as an acclaimed and empowering leader”, which the corporation believes will “undoubtedly” benefit the interests of the shareholder, the Eastern Cape province and the entire country, given the CDC’s role in national economic and social infrastructure projects.
