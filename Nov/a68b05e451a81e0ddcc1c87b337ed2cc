South African private-sector airline group Comair, currently in business rescue, announced on Monday that it was resuming sales of tickets for its Kulula low cost carrier brand. This was in anticipation of Kulula’s resumption of operations on December 1. Comair also operated the British Airways brand in South Africa. “We are excited to be returning to the skies and[,] with competition being restored to the domestic market, the flying public can once again expect to achieve low fares,” said Comair Rescue Consortium representative Glenn Orsmond. “We are proud to continue our Kulula heritage of offering affordable airfares after introducing low cost flying in South Africa close to twenty years ago.” The restart of Kulula flights on domestic routes will be the first phase in the group’s ramp-up of operations, which will continue over the next few months until full operations are restored. The restart of British Airways-branded domestic operations will take place “soon” as will the resumption of Kulula flights from Lanseria International Airport (Johannesburg’s and Pretoria’s second major airport). “This is an important moment for Comair, for all the employees who have been so patient and supportive through the business rescue process, for our customers, the flying public and the country,” he affirmed. “A strong, competitive airline sector benefits everyone and we’re looking forward to welcoming our first customers on board and gradually restoring our schedule and network.” Comair will initially employ a fleet of 15 airliners, covering both brands. The size of the fleet will increase gradually over the next few months. People who booked Comair tickets before the group went into business rescue (which happened on May 5) would be able to use the value of these tickets, via the Comair Travel Bank, for future flights on the airline, with effect from the middle of January.
