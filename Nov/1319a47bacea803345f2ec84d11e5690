Security and safety platform Aura has appointed Alon Lits as its chairperson with immediate effect. Lits is the former Uber sub-Saharan Africa GM. Aura says Lits is to assist Aura CEO Warren Myers to “maximise the opportunities that exist for the growing platform business”. “In my seven-year tenure at Uber I have learnt some valuable lessons and I hope to share these with the Aura team, while helping them continue on their important journey of democratising access to security solutions and medical response across South Africa,” says Lits. With a career that began in leveraged finance at Investec, Lits started at Uber in 2013 as its first GM in Africa. Before leaving, he was a director responsible for the development and sustainable growth of the business that spanned seven countries, 16 cities and 60 000 Uber drivers. He holds an MBA from INSEAD and is also qualified as an associate of the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries, in the UK. Myers says he is confident that Lits will assist Aura to further position itself as a significant platform business in a sector “that is in dire need of assistance”. “We are looking forward to working with Alon to ensure Aura lives up to its promise of providing a platform that will not only assist in reducing crime, but continue to help all South Africans keep safe.” Lits says he has watched Aura build its business since inception in 2017. In addressing both security and medical responses, Lits says Aura has substantial potential not only locally, but also cross-border. “I have every confidence that Aura will continue to build a brand synonymous with making South Africa safer. It is already an impressive business and together, we can create something really exceptional.”
