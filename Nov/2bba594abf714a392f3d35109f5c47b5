The Solidarity Fund has opened a second call for funding applications from nonprofit organisations (NPOs) in the gender-based violence (GBV) sector. Applicants are required to show how a one-off grant of between R500 000 and R1-million from the fund would help the NPO catalyse or accelerate large-scale or systemic change in the GBV sector over the medium to long term. The fund will award one-off grants to successful applicants with a record in various areas relating to the prevention, response and/or access to justice issues within the GBV sector. In a statement on November 5, the fund said every proposal would undergo a well-documented qualitative assessment to enable a sufficiently transparent and justifiable process. From there, the fund will determine the exact amount awarded to successful applicants based on a variety of factors, including the quality of the application, record, partnerships, systemic/catalytic potential and finances. All applications will undergo initial screening and vetting and, if shortlisted, will be forwarded to an independent selection and evaluation panel that will make all final decisions regarding Solidarity Fund funding. A decision on the applications will be communicated in writing within a maximum of three months of the closing date. All applications submitted before the deadline will be considered.
