Enel Group renewable energy subsidiary Enel Green Power and medicines company Novartis have signed a ten-year, 100% renewable virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) for 78 MW of renewable power. This pan-European VPPA will start in January 2022 and will help Novartis achieve its goals for 100% renewable electricity and carbon-neutrality across its European operations by 2025. The energy will be generated by the 179.9 MW TICO Wind Farm, located in the Spanish province of Zaragoza, which will be operational in early 2022. Through the agreement, the renewable energy provided to Novartis will mitigate the emission of around 96 400 t/y of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Enel Green Power global commercial office head Javier Vaquerizo says environmental and sustainability matters are a priority for Novartis. “As Enel Green Power, we are very proud to be a strategic partner and the ‘green enabler’ of part of a major milestone of their journey to be carbon neutral across operations and the company’s supply chain.” He adds that with this deal, Novartis is showcasing the possibilities that pan-European VPPAs can offer to companies committed to fighting climate change. Novartis chief sustainability officer Montse Montaner says that, at Novartis, environmental sustainability is aligned with the company’s purpose to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people’s lives. “Energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions are the cornerstones of our strategy for reducing emissions.” This agreement is part of the Novartis commitment to environmental sustainability by helping make the company both energy and climate-resilient. The company aims to drive sustainability through its operations, as well as those of its suppliers, and has set ambitious targets to reduce its impacts on climate, waste and water. Novartis is committed to using resources efficiently and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, which affect the climate.
