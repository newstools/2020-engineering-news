Manufacturing is one of the sectors that can best assist in growing South Africa's economy and, therefore, the sector's growth must be accelerated, management consulting company Mandela and Associates CEO Dilley Naidoo said during the Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association’s webinar on November 20. He cited the country’s automotive sector as an example of where steps were being taken to further expand the sector. He mentioned that the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, along with other stakeholders, was pursuing the development of an original equipment manufacturer fund, encompassing transformation, localisation and artisanal training. This would be used to develop tier two and three component manufacturers, inclusive of investment for new ownership, value chain development and skills development. Meanwhile, CSIR manufacturing ambassador Dr Martin Sanne spoke about the Fourth Industrial Revolution's role in the manufacturing sector. He noted that it was here to stay and that digital enterprise and smart manufacturing were not going away; therefore, the question was rather how this should be implemented.
