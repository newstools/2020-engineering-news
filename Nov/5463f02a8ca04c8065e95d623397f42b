Transnet Port Terminals' (TPT's) Iron Ore Saldanha Terminal has acquired and commissioned an additional machine to suppress dust. The investment is aimed at protecting the environment and complements the existing dust suppression tools already on site, TPT says. Legally compliant with the atmospheric emissions licence, the terminal has embarked on several mitigation measures including covering stockpiles, wetting cargo and regular cleaning of surrounding surfaces – to make the operation more environment-friendly. These measures also include a tippler sprayer within the enclosure to contain dust during the offloading of trains wagons, a dust extraction plant, atomising sprays providing a fine mist of water particles at the entrance and exit of the conveyer transfer chutes, wetting sprays on the conveyer belts, water cannons and a bucket wheel water spray system. The acquisition of the new machine cost R872 000 and forms part of the terminal’s commitment to improving dust monitoring for a clean operation in Saldanha.
