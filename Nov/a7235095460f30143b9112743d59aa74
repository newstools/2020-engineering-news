With the festive season fast approaching, President Cyril Ramaphosa has asked for vigilance from South Africans to avoid a possible second wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19). He is expected to address the nation this week with an update on government’s Covid-19 strategy. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has also expressed concern at the rising cases, as Eastern Cape hospitals are seeing an influx of Covid-19 patients. Ramaphosa said a resurgence at any scale will reverse the country’s health gains and stunt economic recovery. “To prevent a second wave of Covid-19 infections, we must observe the public health guidelines that remain in place. When we fail to wear a mask at a social gathering, when we attend crowded events, we are not only putting ourselves and others at risk. We are also putting our economic recovery in jeopardy. Let us all continue to play our part,” said Ramaphosa. He reiterated the need for everybody to use masks, social distance and wash hand regularly as the country rebuilds its economy. Ramaphosa stated that had government not intervened when it did, the fallout from the pandemic would have been much worse. Government’s plan to stimulate growth and create jobs falls to the implementation of its Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan. Ramaphosa touted the success of last week’s infrastructure project roundtable, which has seen new funding commitments for infrastructure development. “Plans are being converted to action and commitments are being reflected in jobs and opportunities,” he said.
