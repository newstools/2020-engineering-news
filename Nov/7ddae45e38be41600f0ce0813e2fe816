Consultations evaluating the closure or other alternatives related to former Metso Outotec operations in Vereeniging, South Africa, have been concluded and resulted in the decision to divest the fabrication, machining and assembly operations and close, or rearrange, the rest of the operations. Metso is a process technology, equipment and services company serving the minerals, metals and aggregates industries. Consumables business area president Sami Takalouma on November 3 said the company had “carefully evaluated all opportunities” with the target of finding the best possible option for both customers and employees. About 110 employees will continue with the new local owner in the spare parts manufacturing and repair operations. The unit had had about 200 employees, and the decisions made on the Vereeniging site operations are not related to the Metso Outotec combination, the company said. To ensure the best value, availability and quality, Takalouma confirmed that the mill linings production, as well as pump assembly operations would be transferred to Metso’s other manufacturing units, which have flexible global service capability. “We will continue to have some field service and engineering specialists in Vereeniging to ensure a sustainable transition, as well as uninterrupted service to our customers,” he added. The unit in Vereeniging provides pumps, spare parts, consumables and repair services for the mining industry.
