The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (PRASA’s) long-distance train passenger service Shosholoza Meyl has resumed its major festive season travel routes, effective November 27. Passengers are able to travel from Johannesburg to Cape Town, Durban, Musina, Polokwane, East London, Port Elizabeth and Komatipoort. This follows the halt of operations on all routes for the past eight months, in compliance with mandatory restrictions related to Covid-19. Passengers will now be travelling under heightened Covid-19 hygiene protocols, which will require all travellers to wear face masks throughout their journey. The Shosholoza Meyl’s kitchen service remains suspended and passengers are encouraged to pack their own provisions. The train operators will also check the temperatures of passengers before boarding, with additional temperature checks being performed during the journey. “We have made emergency contingency plans through the provision of an on-board isolation coach with our staff continuously monitoring customers to ensure compliance,” explains PRASA Rail CEO Nosipho Damasane.
