South African motorists can breathe a little easier in November as petrol and diesel prices are both set to decrease on November 3, by 27c/ℓ and 12c/ℓ, respectively. Illuminating paraffin will, however, increase by 15c/ℓ. The adjustments follow as the rand appreciated slightly, on average, against the dollar, which led to lower contributions to the basic fuel prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin of 7.9c/ℓ, 7.5c/ℓ and 7.1c/ℓ, respectively. During the current fuel price review, the average Brent crude oil price decreased slightly from $40.80 to $40.60 owing to the oversupply of crude oil globally, and as the renewed lockdown restrictions across Europe exacerbate the situation.
