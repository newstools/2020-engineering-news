The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) will open and start processing the latest and last round of Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) applications from Monday, November 23. Applications will close at the end of December. This follows the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that the TERS benefits would be extended by another month to October 15. The TERS was established to assist employees who lost income owing to the coronavirus and the regulations limiting economic activity during the various levels of the lockdown. Since March, just over R52-billion has been disbursed in 11.5-million payments through more than one-million employers.
