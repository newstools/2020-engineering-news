At 07:02 GMT, the rand traded at 15.3700 versus the dollar, 0.4% firmer than its previous close. The upbeat global market mood comes after a top official of the US government's vaccine development effort said on Sunday that the first vaccines could be given to US healthcare workers and others recommended by mid-December. That outweighed the domestic impact of downgrades by Fitch and Moody's deeper into "junk" territory on Friday that the Finance Minister called painful. S&P Global affirmed its rating on Friday.

Last week the central bank held its main lending rate at 3.5%. Government bonds were marginally weaker, as the yield on the 2030 bond rose three basis points to 8.845%.
