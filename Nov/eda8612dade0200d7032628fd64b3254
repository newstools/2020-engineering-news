The aggregate water levels of the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) continue to climb as the critical dams feeding it remain stable. The IVRS increased to 57.1% this week, up from the 56.8% recorded in the comparative week last year. “The present levels of the system are equally heathier when judged against the 56.9% at which it stood last week,” the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) explained in a statement. The Vaal dam registered an increase – for the third successive week – in water levels to 36.1% this week, from 35.7% last week and 42.2% in the comparative period last year. The water levels of Grootdraai dam, which has previously been increasing week-on-week, fell from 83.5% last week to 82.9% this week. This is an improvement on the levels of 53% recorded during the comparative week last year. The Sterkfontein dam’s water levels increased for the second consecutive week to 94.9%, while the Bloemhof dam remained stable at 81.3%, also for the second consecutive week. However, the Mohale dam saw its water levels increase slightly from 3.7% last week to 3.9% this week. During the same time last year, the dam stood at 25.3%. The Katse dam’s water levels fell from 24.5% last week to 24.4% this week. However, this is higher compared with the 17.3% it recorded at the same time last year. The DWS, while satisfied that the system has been able to remain in stable position, warns that the water levels of the Vaal dam are at risk of declining as rainfalls are “scarce and far between” and that the stability of the system will be in jeopardy unless businesses and the public save water.
