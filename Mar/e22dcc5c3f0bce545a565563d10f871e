The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) on March 30 reported the delivery of another 100 water tanks to needy communities in Soweto. Amid a national lockdown and an increasing number of Covid-19 cases, the DWS has been deploying water tanks to vulnerable communities to allow them access to water to wash their hands during the pandemic. The 100 water tanks, with a capacity of 2 500 litres, are in addition to the 187 water tanks delivered over the weekend to communities across Gauteng, which has been hardest hit with the largest number of infections in the country “The department is one of the frontline government departments working to ensure that the country is not catastrophically overwhelmed by the virus. Access to water is one of the ways communities will be able to realise that their everyday life is compatible with public health guidelines,” Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu in a statement. The immediate provision of water to desperate communities is aimed at preventing the curve of the virus being even steeper if communities lacked access to water. “The delivery of water to various communities in the province was well underway and proceeding at a satisfactory pace given that Gauteng was profoundly hit by the virus,” said DWS Gauteng provincial head Sibusiso Mthembu. “It is of utmost importance that members of the communities keep the social distance and stay one metre apart as they are out to access water from the water tanks. This is significant in that we must get on top of the virus and that we stop the transmission of the virus,” he continued. He concluded that the work of the department would continue so that the vulnerable were cushioned from the impact coronavirus, noting that that complacency was not an option during this time.
