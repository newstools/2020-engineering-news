All turbine components have been successfully transported to two of the country’s largest wind farms. The final loads for the Perdekraal East Wind Farm arrived on February 21, while the final loads for Kangnas Wind Farm arrived on February 26. “The massive logistical undertaking saw 1 090 loads travel to site, covering more than one-million kilometres, and 55 000 t of wind turbine components being delivered,” said Kangnas and Perdekraal East construction programme manager Christo Loots. Transportation of the first loads for the 140 MW Kangnas Wind Farm began in May 2019, with blades, nacelles and other components travelling from the Saldanha port to site, just outside of Springbok, in the Northern Cape. Transportation of the first loads for the 110 MW Perdekraal East Wind Farm, northeast of Ceres, in the Western Cape, started in June 2019. These wind farms form part of the fourth bid window of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. The farms will start generating power into the national grid later this year.
