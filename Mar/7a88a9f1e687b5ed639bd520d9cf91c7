The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is planning to significantly scale down its operations, as South Africa enters its Covid-19 national lockdown from midnight Thursday, March 26. The authority said on March 26 that it will align its operations to the measures presented by government to curb the spread of the viral disease. “Most of Icasa staff will be working remotely to attend to all queries relating to our business and ensuring that stakeholders, licensees and the general public are attended to at any given point,” Icasa said. “During this period, all stakeholders applying for type-approval certifications are encouraged to make use of our online service to submit such applications.” During the 21-day lockdown, some staff members may be required to attend to business at the office; either to ensure business continuity of essential services or to ensure continued provision of critical services to key stakeholders. “These include, among others, employees in critical positions such as those investigating radio frequency interference cases, will be on standby for any emergencies.” Icasa further extended the closing of the submission for pre-registrations for community broadcasting services from March 31 to April 30.
