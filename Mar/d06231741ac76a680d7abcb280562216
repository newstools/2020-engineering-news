Eskom on Tuesday began implementing an attachment order against the Emfuleni municpality in response to its failure to pay millions in arrears, with the sheriff seizing cars, furniture and other moveable assets. A court order in 2018, gave Eskom the go ahead to recover R615-million in arrears from Emfuleni, in western Gauteng, but according to the loss-making power utility the municipality owes it more than R2.3-billion in total. Municipalities around the country collectively owe Eskom more than R26.4-billion. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha confirmed that the utility was stepping up its campaign to collect arrears from municipalities but said to his knowledge the company did not have a court order in place against any other than Emfuleni. Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter recently said that Soweto, the worst offender in terms of arrears, had seen payment levels double from around 12% to 25% over a three-month period. The company in December started disconnecting residents who fail to pay for power.
