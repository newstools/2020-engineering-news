The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) on Wednesday urged rural dwellers to boil the water that they source from rivers and streams prior to drinking, washing and cooking. With the rampant pollution of water resources in South Africa, the department is concerned that some rural people who depend on rivers for water for basic use may be exposed to the virus that causes Corona. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) patients in South Africa is steadily rising, prompting the department to send out the request to prevent the spread of the viral disease. “The World Health Organisation has warned that behavioural change in hygiene practices is key to combating the spread of the dreaded disease that has wreaked havoc and claimed lives of over [8 000] people and incapacitated thousands of others across the globe,” the DWS said in a statement. The department emphasised the importance of frequent and thorough hand washing with water and soap to avert infections and minimise the contraction of Covid-19.
