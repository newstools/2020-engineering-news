The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) has invited manufacturers operating in the metals and engineering sector to submit their entries for the Seifsa Awards for Excellence. The awards are now in its sixth year and honours both small and big manufactures that promote innovation, transformation, skills development, safe working environments and good business ethics. “For over a decade, the metals and engineering sector has been faced with a myriad of challenges, including sluggish economic growth, lack of demand, rising operating costs and unreliable power supply yet, companies in this crucial sector continue to strive to achieve excellence in their day-to-day operations. “It is against this backdrop that we decided to honour and celebrate such companies and to encourage others to emulate them,” says Seifsa CE Kaizer Nyatsumba. Companies have until April 28 to submit their entries. The awards are presented in seven categories, including Most Innovative Company of the Year, which commends innovation in research and development or production; and Health and Safety Award of the Year, which commends the company with the best legal compliance record or the lowest lost-time injury frequency rate. Other awards are the Customer Service Award, the Environmental Stewardship Award, the Artisan Award, the Best Corporate Social Investment Award and the Most Transformed Company of the Year. The awards ceremony will be held in Boksburg on May 28. Last year, HC Heat Exchangers won Most Innovative Company of the Year, while Pamodzi Unique Engineering walked away with the Most Transformed accolade.
