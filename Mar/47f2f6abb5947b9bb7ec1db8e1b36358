The Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) has advised that a passenger who used the Gautrain Park and Sandton stations has tested positive for Covid-19, and urges visitors to these stations between March 12 and 14 to be vigilant about any symptoms. The businessman was visiting the Bombela Operating Companyâ€™s offices, in Midrand, after originally travelling from France, on the three days in question and has since been in self-isolation. The GMA said individuals who were in close contact with him had already been identified and advised to remain in self-isolation. The GMA has since chemically decontaminated both stations and is also undertaking train, station and bus cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day and at night when the trains are back in the depot. Other measures implemented to help contain and avoid the spread of Covid-19 include regularly cleaning and disinfecting touchpoints such as handrails, door handles and station washrooms. The GMA said it was also disinfecting the air ducts on trains as an additional safety measure, although the virus had, thus far, not been considered to be airborne. The public transport provider added that its contractors were engaging with their employees and unions on the safety of employees and were implementing measures accordingly. Hand sanitisers have also been made available at Gautrain stations, while the GMA is also using various communication channels to advise passengers and staff to wash their hands regularly and provide updates from the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health.
