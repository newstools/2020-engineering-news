The Saldanha Bay Industrial Development Zone (SBIDZ) has signed three new investment agreements worth R300-million, bringing the total number of signed investors to 11. The SBIDZ has also recently launched several new developments that are expected to contribute to the growth of the economy and create jobs in the West Coast region. Construction has started on the first investment project – a specialised corrosion protection facility – and building plans have been submitted for an additional two investment projects involving specialised manufacturing and fabrication, as well as partial assembly and manufacturing of components that are currently imported into South Africa. The SBIDZ also has an investor pipeline that continues to grow, not only in manufacturing and warehousing facilities, but also in new-build port infrastructure. Several private investors have undertaken, at their own cost, bankable feasibility studies that demonstrate demand for repair, maintenance and equipment servicing facilities linked to the oil and gas and marine services sectors, and it is anticipated that these investments will be announced soon. The Saldehco Offshore Supply Base in the Port of Saldanha Bay is one such investment that has made good progress, with construction on the facility set to begin in the fourth quarter, pending completion of design development and necessary statutory approvals. This facility will offer internationally competitive services to vessels passing along the country’s coastline, as well as to projects looking to undertake surveys, exploration and production activity on the West Coast. The SBIDZ has also started construction on the Access Complex Building – a 5 ha commercial office facility – that is due to be completed in April. These investments in the SBIDZ are expected to create jobs through the construction of the tenant facility and, as these open their doors, provide more opportunities for jobs in the oil and gas, maritime fabrication and repair industries and related support services industries.
