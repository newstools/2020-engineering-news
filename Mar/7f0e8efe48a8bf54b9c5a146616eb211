Phosphates and phosphoric acid producer Foskor has advised that it will continue with mining activities in Phalaborwa and its processing operations in Richards Bay, owing to it being an essential service in providing products to the agriculture and food sectors in South Africa, during the national lockdown. Engineering News on March 25 reported that Foskor would not be operating during South Africa’s national lockdown period – March 27 to April 16 – although the company qualifies as an essential service provider, owing to having little control over its suppliers' activities during this time. However, subsequent events and the publication of more regulations have led to the company saying it will operate during the lockdown. Foskor produces phosphate-based products that are essential and critical for use in agricultural and fertiliser products and in the production of animal feed used as a food supplement for livestock and poultry. As such, Foskor is a necessary link in the supply chain of food security and will accordingly continue its operations. Foskor president and CEO Riaan Rademan explains in a March 26 statement that the company is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees and contractors throughout this very unfortunate and challenging period. “We are all required as South Africans and global citizens to be patriotic and do our best to ensure that we curb the spread of Covid-19 among people, and limit its impact on the food chain which remains central for the basic survival of our people."
