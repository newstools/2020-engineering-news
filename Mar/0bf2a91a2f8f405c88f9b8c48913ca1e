An urgent court application to set aside Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula’s decision to appoint Bongisizwe Mpondo as administrator of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has been postponed to April 21. The court application was lodged by civil society coalition UniteBehind, which also requested the two-week postponement. In a statement on Wednesday, the Department of Transport said Mbalula was amenable to a postponement. “He still contends that this matter could be discussed between the parties without involving courts, as both parties are driven by ensuring that there is efficacy at PRASA and same is in the best interest of rail commuters,” the department stated. Mbalula still contends that he acted within the law in appointing Mpondo, it added.
