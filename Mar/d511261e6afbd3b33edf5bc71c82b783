The Department of Small Business Development has published, on its website, the Guidelines for Application for the Debt Relief Finance Scheme and Business Growth/Resilience Facility. The online application form will be available from April 2; however, only small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are registered on the database will be considered. SMEs are, therefore, advised to register their businesses at https://smmesa.gov.za/ Additionally, the department has also published a request for proposals (RFPs) to existing South African-owned, -registered and -tax compliant SMEs in the medical supply and non-food sectors. The RFPs are aimed at getting information on SMEs that have the capability to participate in the manufacture and supply of goods that are needed towards the management of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. These documents are also available on the department’s website, or SMEs can, alternatively, email the department at info@dsbd.gov.za or call the hotline number on 0860 663 7867.
