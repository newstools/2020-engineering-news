State-owned Transnet has designated properties across three provinces to be used as quarantine sites and shelters for the homeless during South Africa's 21-day lockdown period. Transnet, in partnership with local government authorities in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State, will support the efforts to implement the national lockdown across the country. The lockdown requires that all citizens stay indoors, but for those who cannot self-quarantine and self-isolate at home, these facilities will act as temporary shelters to help reduce the impact of the outbreak. The local governments will provide catering, security and waste removal for all facilities. In Gauteng, Transnet has made its Esselen Park School of Rail Campus and Parkhill Lodge properties and facilities available as quarantine sites. These two properties have been made available from March 27 until April 16. In KwaZulu-Natal, Transnetâ€™s 60 Mayor's Walk building, in Pietermaritzburg, will also be used to provide shelter for the homeless and has been made available from March 27 until April 17. The municipality has committed to ensuring quality living conditions for people to deal with this new hard-hitting reality. A student lodge in Bloemfontein, in the Free State province, is currently being used to accommodate homeless people for the duration of the lockdown from March 25 until April 17. In total, these facilities will have the capacity to take over 600 people during the lockdown period.
