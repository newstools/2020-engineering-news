In light of the spread of Covid-19 in South Africa, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) has suspended all fieldwork activities until March 31. The committee will continue to look at the prevailing environment to inform its decisions. “Stats SA wishes to thank our field staff who went out on a daily basis under very challenging circumstances, and our respondents for continuing to supply us with their information, which is the lifeblood of this organisation, to provide statistics for our nation to make informed decisions. These are extraordinary times that we are living in, and they demand extraordinary responses. "Let this be the year of unity and nation building. Together, we can beat this virus,” the organisation said in a statement.
