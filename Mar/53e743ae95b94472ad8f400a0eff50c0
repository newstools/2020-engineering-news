Hydrogen company Nel Hydrogen US has been defined as “essential manufacturing business” by the Connecticut state and the plant in Wallingford has, therefore, been allowed to resume operations amid the outbreak of Covid-19. However, revenues and operations will still be negatively impacted by disruptions in the value chain and extraordinary health measures taken owing to the spread of the virus. “The safety and wellbeing of our employees and co-citizens are our top priority and we have implemented strict measures to ensure continued and safe operations. Due to parts of our business relating to national security and critical societal functions, we have been defined as an essential manufacturing business and will resume operations at our plant in Wallingford,” says CEO Jon André Løkke. Following a state executive order in Connecticut, issued earlier this month, Nel temporarily suspended manufacturing at the Wallingford plant. The suspension was initially expected to continue through to April 22. However, businesses defined as essential manufacturing are permitted to continue operations and, through a dialogue with state authorities, Nel has received approval to continue operations.
