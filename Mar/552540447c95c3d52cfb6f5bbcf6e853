The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) has launched the Ehlanzeni District Resistance and Liberation Heritage Route, in Mbombela. Speaking at the launch, on Friday, MTPA CEO Johannes Nobunga indicated that the primary purpose of the route was to complete the last leg of the Mpumalanga Resistance and Liberation Heritage Route. “The Ehlanzeni District Resistance and Liberation Heritage route is part of the Mpumalanga chapter of the National Liberation Heritage Route, spearhead by the Mpumalanga Department of Culture, Sports and Recreation, to map out, document and preserve Mpumalanga routes to independence. It highlights the key destinations that featured prominently during the liberation struggle,” he noted. He explained that the Ehlanzeni district had played an important role in the last phase of the struggle as a passage for those that entered and exited South Africa through Mozambique and eSwatini. Nobunga added that the new route enhanced and diversified tourism offering in the province. He said the rich history of the route had been packaged to allow tour operators to sell tourism packages that relate to the history and culture of the province. “The route is intended to preserve our country’s struggle history for future generations. It is our responsibility as a tourism agency to promote the various tourism offerings in the province and diversify the market in order to allow tourists to stay longer. "Each of the towns provide tourism products and services that will encourage tourists to visit and experience the route in its entirety,” he stated.
