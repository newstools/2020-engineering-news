Europe-based major global aerospace group Airbus announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily halting work at its facilities in France and Spain. This is the result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The halt, which will see a temporary cessation of production and assembly work at these facilities, will be for four days. “This will allow sufficient time to implement stringent health and safety conditions in terms of hygiene, cleaning and self-distancing, while improving the efficiency of operations under the new working conditions,” said the company in its statement. This measure was adopted following the decisions of the French and Spanish governments to enforce further restrictions in attempts to contain Covid-19. Also as a consequence of these policies, in these two countries Airbus will seek to maximise the number of employees working from home. “These measures will be implemented locally in coordination with the social partners,” stated the group. “Airbus is also working together with its customers and suppliers to minimise the impact of this decision on their operations.” The company was closely observing the evolution of Covid-19 around the world. It gave the assurance that it was following the guidance issued by the World Health Organisation and the various national health agencies. “Airbus … is constantly assessing the situation, the impact on employees, customers, suppliers and the business. … Airbus continuously updates its workplace safety and travel recommendations to employees, customers and visitors, according to the latest developments.”
