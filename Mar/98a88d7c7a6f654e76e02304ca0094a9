Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) has launched the first of its off-grid, solar-powered groundwater harvesting and treatment projects to commemorate National Water Week. The first project, called Coke Ville, is based in the Tshikota village community, just west of Louis Trichardt, in Limpopo. It comprises three boreholes that can provide up to 157 200 ℓ/d of water to the community. The system, therefore, can provide sufficient water for at least 2 000 households. The community previously suffered frequent water shortages, which resulted in community unrest, like many other villages in the province that also do not have access to clean running water. While government has allocated R3.5-billion to address the water situation in Limpopo, the issue cannot be solved by the public sector alone, says CCBSA community development enterprise head Tsholofelo Mqhayi. She adds that the most effective work happens when there is collaboration between the public and private sectors for the benefit of local communities. “CCBSA fully understands the impact of the lack of water within communities, that is why we aim to empower people through equitable access to safe water, sanitation and improved climate resilience. "Through this initiative, we hope to strengthen safe water access and sanitation in humanitarian relief to help communities stay healthy and recover from disasters faster and hopefully inspire people to participate in water protection, access and conservation.”
