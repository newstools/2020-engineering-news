French car manufacturer Renault on Thursday temporarily suspended its manufacturing operations in Casablanca and Tangier amid global concern over the Covid-19 outbreak. The plants employ over 11 000 people, according to online publication Morocco World News. The company suspended production at its Portuguese plant on Wednesday. Renault said via a statement that non-essential functions at its plants in the north African kingdom would take place remotely. The manufacturer also reiterated that preventative measures had been implemented internally, since the start of the outbreak, at its factories, and commercial and tertiary networks. Renault said it was closely monitoring the situation in the kingdom and was ready to react to any changes, including new measures introduced by the Moroccan government. The country has confirmed 61 cases of the coronavirus and two people have died as a result of the infection.
