Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI) presents a number of opportunities for business. Speaking on the second day of the Black Business Council's yearly summit, he said the Department of Health was determining the mechanisms for implementing the NHI. He pointed out that there was an infrastructure backlog in reconstruction and refurbishment of health facilities in the country, which was an area where the private sector could get involved. He further noted that South Africa had the potential to become a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub, owing to its technical and research capabilities.
