The government of Mozambique is exploring ways to enhance cooperation with South Africa in the energy sector, following South Africa’s Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe’s working visit to Maputo. Mozambique’s Energy Minister Ernesto Max Tonela held a closed door meeting with Mantashe last month. Portuguese News Agency Lusa reported that the two neighbouring countries will now consider ways to boost the existing cooperation in the energy sector, with the aim of addressing the crippling power deficit in southern Africa. Pascoal Bacela said Mozambique’s support could help South Africa overcome the current power deficiencies. “Mozambique has plans to increase its availability of energy, taking into account the domestic and southern African markets,” Bacela was quoted as saying by Lusa. During the visit to Maputo last month, Mantashe wrote on Facebook: “Meeting with H.E Ernesto Max Tonela, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, to discuss government to government relations and how South Africa and Mozambique can complement each other on energy related issues”. “Mozambique is increasingly becoming a strategic country for South Africa to meet its domestic gas imperatives in the energy sector”. Last year, Mantashe referred delegates at the Africa Oil Week in Cape Town to South Africa’s Integrated Resource Plan recently approved by Cabinet, and flagged its provision for gas-to-power projects from 2024. Mantashe made specific mention of major gas discoveries in Mozambique and Tanzania, noting “we remain ready to contribute to the development of these recent finds”.
