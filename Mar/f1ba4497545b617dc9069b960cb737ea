The Blue Train has announced the suspension of its transport service between Pretoria and Cape Town effective immediately, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, owned by State-owned freight utility Transnet, on Thursday said the suspension would be effective until April 30, as advised by a risk assessment done by the operations team earlier this week. The team will review the duration of the suspension again in mid-April, depending on the situation. The company has already apprised its booked, paid and confirmed guests of changes to the cancellation policy to accommodate potential travel disruptions owing to Covid-19. The guests who were due to travel on the train between March 18 and up to August 31 can postpone travel to any date from September 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. Alternatively, guests can cancel confirmed bookings and receive a full refund.
