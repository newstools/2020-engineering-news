The National Small Business Chamber (NSBC) has launched a Covid-19 Small Business Relief Centre to assist businesses during this crisis. The centre collaborates with experts in various business fields, which should help small businesses weather the storm successfully. The centre will focus on ensuring low-interest disaster recovery loans, moratoriums on vehicle and equipment leases, bond repayments, and effective supplier negotiation and communication. It can also help around landlord negotiation with regard to property leases, increased cleaning protocols, digital marketing strategies during a time of crisis, quick digital migration for meetings and business continuity plan creation. The NSBC calls on more experts to join in with suggestions and advise it on adding value to the centre to help make small businesses more resilient to Covid-19-related economic disruptions.
