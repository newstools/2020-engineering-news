The South African Revenue Services (Sars) has acknowledged the impact the spread of Covid-19 could have on businesses and people within an already struggling economy. Consequently, it has pledged its commitment to maintaining the essential services that it provides in efforts to mitigate the unfavourable conditions arising from the global pandemic. In discharging this responsibility, Sars on March 30 said it was balancing the safety of its staff, taxpayers and traders, while ensuring that the South African economy continues to be able to function. As of March 30, Sars had paid out refunds to taxpayers amounting to R2.4-billion over the four days of lockdown. South Africa’s national lockdown started on March 27 and will continue until April 16. The refunds comprise payments to large business amounting to R1.1-billion and payments to small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs) amounting to R1.3-billion. The payment of refunds represents a major cash injection into the economy at a very critical period, Sars said, adding that it “can only do this if taxpayers and traders remain compliant by fulfilling their filing and payment obligations even during the lockdown”. Sars has made several channels available to continue fulfilling these obligations. These channels include the MobiApp, eFiling, e@syFile and the Sars contact centre, which can be contacted on 0800 00 7277. Taxpayers and traders are urged to use these channels to make payments that are due on or before March 31, 2020 and remain compliant. “It also remains imperative that various categories of businesses in distress continue to be compliant in order to access the tax relief measures that government has put in place to counter the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Sars pleaded in the statement.
