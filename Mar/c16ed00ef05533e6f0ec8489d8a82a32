Juwi Renewable Energies achieved a record one-million lost-time-incident- (LTI-) free hours at the end of the February. The renewable energy company is building the 78 MW Bokamoso Solar Park, near Leeudoringstad, in North West. The achievement is equivalent to 125 people working on a remote site for 1 000 days without incident or harm to anyone. The Bokamoso Solar Park is part of Round 4 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. CEO Greg Austin attributed the achievement to tremendous duty and care of the Juwi site management team and excellent cooperation of labour on site. “We have strict procedures and standards in place to create a safe working environment, where everyone feels safe and completes their tasks in the correct safety gear. We have reached this achievement by creating an environment where everyone looks out for their co-workers and peers,” says Juwi construction manager Jacques Botha. He adds that the LTI achievement is extraordinary, considering that the local communities had very limited work experience and chance to develop safety awareness. “By implementing the correct safety procedures and standards, and by creating a safety awareness environment, we were able to reach over one-million LTI-free hours. We want to make sure that everyone goes back to their families safely.”
