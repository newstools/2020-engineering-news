JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – South Africa’s diversified black-controlled mining and minerals company African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) on Tuesday announced that its FD Abigail Mukhuba would be stepping down with effect from the end of September to pursue a new career, and that ARM senior executive finance: corporate and tax Derrick King had been appointed acting FD. King was part of the now defunct Anglovaal and continued in the finance department after the Anglovaal takeover by ARM in 2004. A process of identifying a permanent successor from internal and external candidates would be embarked upon. ARM, headed by executive chairperson Dr Patrice Motsepe, has interests in a wide range of mines, including platinum group metals, iron, manganese, coal, nickel, copper and gold mines. ARM and the Motsepe family on Saturday formed the key part of the partnership of companies and organisations that pledged R1-billion to assist with the coronavirus pandemic and its related challenges that are confronting South Africa and the African continent. In its 2019 financial year, the activities of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed ARM created R13-billion worth of financial value.
