The Factory of the Year competition that culminates in an awards ceremony held at the Manufacturing Indaba every year has been postponed. Event organisers nationwide have, for the last month, had to postpone or cancel events to reduce the risk of further Covid-19 infections. A member of the competition’s planning committee Igor Hulak says the submission window has been extended for entries in the competition to June 30 and that the new date for the Factory of the Year awards ceremony will be confirmed in due course. “The safety of the speakers and participants at both events are the main priority and it is essential that everyone takes the necessary precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus in South Africa.”
