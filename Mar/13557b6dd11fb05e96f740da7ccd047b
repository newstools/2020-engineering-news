Poultry producer Astral Foods has refuted fake news that has been doing the rounds on social media, claiming that some of its employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and that the Health Minister has ordered a shutdown of an Astral's production facility. The company on March 31 said the “news” is depicted as a television-news-type screenshot, which it strongly believes has been illegitimately produced. Astral confirmed that none of its employees have tested positive for Covid-19. The company affirmed that it was following stringent hygiene protocols and that it had implemented a multitude of measures to ensure the health and wellbeing of its staff during this time, especially since the company’s operations are considered an essential service.
