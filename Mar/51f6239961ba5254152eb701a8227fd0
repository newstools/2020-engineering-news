The United National Transport Union (UNTU) has acknowledged the decision of Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe to reopen the iron ore rail line operated by State-owned Transnet. This will require Transnet employees from various divisions to be ready to report for duty from March 30. These employees will be provided with the necessary documentation to indicate to authorities that they are now required to travel to and from work. UNTU has informed Transnet that its members will, however, not work if personal protective equipment (PPE) is not provided to them. There is currently a global shortage of PPE as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
