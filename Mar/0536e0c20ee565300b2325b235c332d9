Eskom will implement stage 1 load shedding from 9am on Monday morning to 11pm on Monday night, the state-owned power utility said. "It is envisaged that load shedding may continue to be implemented until Thursday," Eskom said in a statement on Sunday night. This was due to a number of units still on "unplanned breakdowns", which would only return to service during the course of the week. It would also help Eskom to rebuild the emergency reserves that were depleted "as we strove to keep the lights on during the high equipment breakdowns we experienced towards the end of last week". Implementing load shedding would put Eskom in a better position to meet the rising demand during the week. Work was also continuing to return to service some of the "unplanned breakdowns we experienced". The system was currently constrained, unpredictable, and vulnerable. Demand had also incrementally risen since January, putting pressure on the ageing fleet. Eskom urged South Africans to cooperate in managing electricity consumption with care to help minimise load shedding. "Unplanned breakdowns" or outages were at 11,700 MW as at 7.20pm on Sunday night and planned maintenance outages were at 4963 MW.
