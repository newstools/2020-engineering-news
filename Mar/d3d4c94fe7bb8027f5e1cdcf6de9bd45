Financial services company HSBC has invited immigrants to South Africa to share their experiences of the country in the company’s 2020 Expat Explorer Survey. The survey is also known as the annual league table of best places to live and work and is now running for the thirteenth year. It collects the opinions of thousands of people around the world who have relocated. Respondents had until March 6 to respond to the survey. The survey explores many aspects of life abroad from pay and career progression to lifestyle, health, security and education. This year’s survey will be completed and published in June. HSBC says South Africa gets high weather ratings with almost every year’s survey, but highlights that expats also feel that their career prospects and quality of life improved when they moved to the country. “Hundreds of expats living in South Africa have taken part each year, with the results suggesting that professionals moving to South Africa tend to extend their stays or settle permanently in the country. “We are looking to build on that insight this year by encouraging even more local expats to take part and share their opinions and experiences, so that these insights can help others better understand what life is really like for expats in South Africa and what it is that makes the country a fulfilling destination to live and work,” says HSBC expat head John Goddard.
