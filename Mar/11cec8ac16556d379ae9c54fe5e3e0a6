Twelve wind farms that are still under construction have declared force majeure, as they are not deemed to be essential service providers during the 21-day national lockdown. The South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) says that, following consultation with the Department of Energy’s Independent Power Producers Office, it has confirmed that the nationwide lockdown is an event of force majeure under the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed for these wind farm projects. This means that delays, directly related to the lockdown period, will not attract any penalties. The industry is working to support its beneficiary communities through economic development obligations, by re-directing socioeconomic development funds toward Covid-19 response activities, where possible. SAWEA also notes that many beneficiary community offices located in rural areas across the country, have become information centres and are working closely with joint committees on municipal and district level to assist during this crisis period. Both closed communication groups and social media platforms are providing official educational material and resources to the communities.
