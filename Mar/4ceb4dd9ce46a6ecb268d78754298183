Eskom says it will continue increase load shedding to Stage 2 from 9am on Tuesday, which is likely to continue for the rest of the week due to further delays on some generation units that were expected to return to service on Monday. Eskom says the delays have put additional pressure on the system and have necessitated an increase in the load shedding stage. "As the ageing fleet is currently constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable, we advise South Africans that the stage of load shedding may change at short notice should there be any unexpected change in the generation system performance," Eskom said in a statement. "Demand has also incrementally risen since January. We urge every South African to co-operate in managing electricity consumption with care to help us minimise load shedding. Eskom once again urged consumers to conserve use of electricity through a host of measures to assist a reduced demand. These include shorter morning showers during peak hours, thawing food for dinners from the morning in the fridge (rather than defrosting in a microwave oven), setting air-conditioners at a constant 23ÂºC and switching off geysers over peak periods. Eskom said consumers could check their load shedding schedules on its website for amendments.
