The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) plans to call a hearing with embattled State-owned power utility Eskom, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and various stakeholders and provincial departments that owe Eskom money to come up with a solution for settling that debt. The hearing will take place later this month, on March 18, and will involve representatives from the South African Local Government Association, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, as well as MECs of provincial departments. In a statement on Wednesday, Scopa said the committee had been informed in December that the function of the fifth administration’s Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) had been transferred to the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Service Delivery (IMCSD), led by the Deputy President and Leader of Government Business. According to Scopa, the sixth administration should have continued to deal with the issue. In correspondence to Scopa, the Parliamentary Counsellor to the Deputy President informed the committee that the IMCSD had not been mandated to deal with debt owed to Eskom. Scopa on Wednesday indicated that it “is disturbed by the failure of the executive to come with a coordinated approach of dealing with the Eskom debt”, particularly since Eskom is the major contributor to the current technical recession.
 
Scopa said it would come up with a roadmap to deal with how these intergovernmental challenges can be resolved. The committee’s objective is to ensure that Eskom moves towards “a direction of viability and profitability”.
