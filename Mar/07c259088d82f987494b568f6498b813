Eskom says that while it still does not expect to implement rotational load-shedding on Monday, the likelihood of power cuts has increased. "Overnight some generation units tripped unexpectedly, further reducing available capacity. We are utilising more emergency generation reserves than initially planned to supplement supply," it said in a power update on Monday morning. Unplanned breakdowns or outages were at 13 804MW on Monday morning, and planned maintenance outages at 6 511MW. Eskom added that some generation units are expected to return to service on Monday and Tuesday, which would improve the power system outlook for the week. The utility reminded customers that the country's generation system remains constrained, vulnerable and unpredictable, meaning power cuts could be implemented at short notice. It asked consumers to continue using electricity sparingly to help curb demand. The cash-strapped utility has warned of an increased likelihood of power cuts over approximately the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
