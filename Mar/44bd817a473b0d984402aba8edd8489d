Toll route manager Trans African Concessions (Trac) says the upgrade of the N4 highway between Belfast and Machadodorp is progressing well and is 26% complete. It is expected that the main contractor WBHO Construction will complete the R400-million project in three years’ time. The upgrade includes the rehabilitation of 30 km of Section 5B, as well as a four-lane carriageway. To date, the upgrade has created 300 jobs, while 21 local small, medium-sized and microenterprises have been appointed, as per a memorandum signed between the eMakhazeni local municipality, Trac, the South African National Roads Agency, WBHO and construction company Motheo. Blasting and cutting activity is progressing on schedule, with blasting notifications apparent along the route and on Trac’s social media pages. Trac notes that several traffic accommodations have been implemented on the route and will remain in place throughout the construction period, including speed reductions, contraflows and occasional stop and go’s.
