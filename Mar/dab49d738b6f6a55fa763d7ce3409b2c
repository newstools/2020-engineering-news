In response to industry calls for equipment that will improve performance across its operations, Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) has invested R2-billion to replace aging equipment this calendar year. This includes two mobile harbour cranes for the Port Elizabeth Container Terminal, which will largely benefit the automotive and the agricultural bulk sectors. The East London Multi-Purpose Terminal, meanwhile, is set to receive four straddle carriers to better service the automotive sector, while a new tippler for the Saldanha Bulk Terminal will support growing bulk volumes attributed to the mining activities in the country. The terminal’s mobile ship loaders are currently undergoing commissioning with the intention to contribute to operations by April. The Richards Bay Bulk Terminal has been receiving new excavators since 2018 and another five are due to arrive before the end of the 2020/21 financial year. The terminal will also receive a ship loader and a new conveyor belt that will unlock tippler capacity in the same year. TPT is also procuring 43 straddle carriers for the Durban Container Terminals. These are expected at the start of the 2020/21 financial year. Four straddle carriers will also be acquired for the Cape Town Container Terminal. “Equipment is at the centre of loading and unloading goods off a vessel in an operation like ours, which is around the clock and covers four major sectors namely containers, cars, bulk and break bulk cargo. "Beyond responding to industry calls – the morale of our employees is also impacted by resources available to them to deliver. Considering the remarkable work employees deliver despite aging equipment, we can be confident of new performance records in the near future,” comments TPT acting COO Velile Dube.
