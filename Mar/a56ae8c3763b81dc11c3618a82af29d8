No load-shedding was expected on Friday and over the weekend, Eskom said. "Even though the generation system remains constrained, Eskom does not expect to implement load-shedding this weekend although unplanned breakdowns remain above the 10 500 MW mark," the State-owned power utility said via a statement. "We remind South Africans, however, that the generation system remains vulnerable and unpredictable, and as such, there is a possibility that we may have to implement load-shedding at short notice should there be an unexpected change in the generation system performance." It said unplanned breakdowns or outages were at 10 728 MW as at 06:50 on Friday morning while planned maintenance outages were at 4 660 MW. "We remind South Africans that there is a possibility of increased load-shedding as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health," said Eskom, which has notÂ implemented rotational powercuts since February 22.
