Information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart device provider Huawei has donated R1-million toward South Africa’s efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. The South Africa-China Economic and Trade Association, at the Chinese Embassy in Pretoria, donated a further R2-million to the Department of Health, which will be used for testing and managing the outbreak. “The donation is a very important mark of friendship, solidarity and partnership from Huawei and other Chinese businesses,” said Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. “There have been a huge amount of lessons that South Africa and the world have learnt from China’s management of the virus,” he continued, noting that despite about 80 000 infections, not one South African living in China had been infected. Globally, there have been nearly 350 000 infections since December, close to 15 000 fatalities and about 100 000 recoveries. Some 192 countries have been impacted around the world. South Africa, which was recently declared a state of disaster after recording its first case early in March, has about 274 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with expectations that this will increase. “Digital connectivity will help to make the management and containment of the virus more efficient,” noted Huawei South Africa CEO Spawn Fan, reiterating the company’s commitment to ICT and as a social partner to South African business, government and society. “We believe in the power of connectivity and technology and we are committed to harnessing ICT in the fight against coronavirus in South Africa and on the [African] continent. “In China, we saw the success of remote education, remote health services and working from home during quarantine periods. Coronavirus is not just a threat to life, its knock-on effects on livelihoods and the economy must also be managed,” he stated.
