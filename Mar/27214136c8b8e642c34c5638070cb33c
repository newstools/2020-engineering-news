Loadshedding was not expected on Tuesday, but the possibility of rotational blackouts had increased due to a high number unplanned outages, Eskom said on Monday night. "We are utilising emergency generation reserves to supplement supply. The generation system remains constrained, vulnerable and unpredictable. Loadshedding could be implemented at short notice if there is a change in the generation system performance," said the utility. It said unplanned breakdowns or outages were at 13 297MW at 3.40pm on Monday afternoon and planned maintenance outages were at 3 683MW. "We remind South Africans that there is a possibility of increased loadshedding as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health." Eskom further asked customers to continue using electricity sparingly in order to reduce demand.
