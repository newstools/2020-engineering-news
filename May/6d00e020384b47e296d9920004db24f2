South African Real Estate Investment Trust Association (SA Reit) has appointed Joanne Solomon as its first CEO, effective May 1. The association represents publicly traded Reits in South Africa, which have a total market capitalisation of R300-billion. For the past eight years, SA Reit has been driven by volunteer leadership alone. However, with its growing responsibilities and activities, it became appropriate to appoint an executive representative for the association. SA Reit says Solomon has more than 20 years’ experience in senior and executive roles. Prior to joining SA Reit, she was head of brand and client insights at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking, as well as head of marketing for Nedbank Corporate Property Finance. She also served on national and regional councils of the South African Property Owners Association, while she was also a chairperson of the Women’s Property Network and a member of the South African Council of Shopping Centres’ Congress Committee. SA Reit chairperson Estienne de Klerk says Solomon has unique experience in the property industry and financial sector, making her the perfect fit for the new role, which will add significant value to the association and its members, as well as the broader property sector.
