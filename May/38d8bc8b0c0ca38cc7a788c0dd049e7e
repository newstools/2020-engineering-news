The first steps in relaxing South Africa’s national coronavirus lockdown will allow critical supplies of cement and construction material to reach specified markets. “With the lowering . . . to Alert Level 4, the new regulations permit AfriSam to resume some of its production and to supply certain customers,” says AfriSam sales and marketing executive Richard Tomes. The company will now be supplying aggregate, readymix and cement products to permitted Alert Level 4 customers. The changes were recently signed into law by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. However, Tomes assures that, despite the relaxation in the regulations, there will still be stringent safety procedures in place to protect the health and wellbeing of employees, customers and other stakeholders. “All visitors to our sites will be required to adhere to strict procedures – aligned to the current regulations – which remain in place,” he says and adds that these will apply to all permitted customers who will be collecting product at AfriSam sites. He also emphasises that AfriSam staff adhere closely to regulations when making deliveries to customer sites. This includes the wearing of masks at all times, sanitising and maintaining an appropriate physical distance. “We understand that these are difficult and challenging times for the industries we serve and are doing what we can to support the economy’s partial recovery after the first phase of the lockdown,” he says. “At the same time, we will be keeping all other visits to customer sites by AfriSam employees to an absolute minimum. These will only take place if they are critical, and if they are permitted under Alert Level 4 restrictions.”
