South Africa's National Treasury on Wednesday said it would table a new budget on June 24 to ratify plans for a R500-billion stimulus package aimed at easing the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. "A revised fiscal framework will also be presented, to account for substantial revenue losses emanating from the economic shock of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown," it said in a statement.
