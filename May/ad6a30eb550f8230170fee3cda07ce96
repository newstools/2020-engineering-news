Open-access fibre-connectivity provider DFA has been granted an operating licence in Zimbabwe, enabling the build-out of a nationwide network for the provision of licensed telecommunications services. The Postal and Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) awarded the firm an Internet Access Provider Class B licence, with DFA becoming the first telecommunications provider in ten years to be granted an operating licence. This followed a successful launch and proof-of-concept phase for DFA’s Zimbabwe operations. “From the beginning, we have favoured a measured approach in our expansion to nations outside of South Africa. We believe in the potential of Zimbabwe’s telecommunications industry and therefore, we have identified it as a good place to invest in. The awarding of the licence further builds our confidence in this particular market,” said DFA Group CEO Thinus Mulder. DFA Zimbabwe used the licensing period to deploy more resources towards understanding the market needs, building internal capabilities and improving its business model to further enhance customers’ experience, added DFA Zimbabwe CEO Simon Chimutsotso. “We look forward to partnering with our targeted customer base to enhance their efficiency and competitiveness. By fulfilling their physical fibre-network-infrastructure requirements and taking on the maintenance responsibilities, we enable them to focus on their core business of providing excellent value-added telecommunication services to their customers,” he concluded.
