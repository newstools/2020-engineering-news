Ratings agency S&P Global Ratings (S&P) has revised JSE-listed Telkom’s long-term issuer rating in line with the sovereign ratings downgrade in April. Telkom, which is viewed as a government-related entity, has been revised downwards from BB+ to BB, with the negative outlook revised to stable. “This rating action follows the downgrade of South Africa’s long-term local currency rating on April 29, from BB to BB- with a stable outlook,” the company said in an update to shareholders. This was a result of the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the fiscus and the growth outlook. “However, the rating agency has always maintained the low likelihood of negative interventions by government. “It also considers a moderate impact of Covid-19 on Telkom’s financial profile and recognises the company’s modest financial risk. The ascribed stable outlook also takes into account Telkom’s standalone credit profile of bbb-,” Telkom concluded.
