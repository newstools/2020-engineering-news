The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has closed off a section of Christiaan de Wet road, after the road subsided as a result of damaged stormwater infrastructure. The left lane of the road behind Clearwater Shopping Mall, towards Ontdekkers road, has been closed off to traffic as of May 17, until further notice. The JRA advises motorists to adhere to the reduced speed limits, as this section before Wilgerood road has very sharp curves. Infrastructure development head Siyabonga Genu says the road infrastructure will require urgent rehabilitation and the installation of a new stormwater drainage system, as this is a major arterial road. “The rehabilitation is estimated to cost about R25-million; however, the cost will only be finalised once design solutions have been developed. "In the meantime, we have implemented a temporary closure on the left lane (East or West direction) to ensure the safety of our road users. All other lanes on that road remain unaffected and are open to traffic,” he says.
