The Bargaining Council for the Civil Engineering Industry (BCCEI) took an unprecedented step in April when it announced that it would waive the BCCEI administration and dispute levy contributions for that month. In bringing further relief to an already ailing industry sector, the BCCEI has now extended this waiver to May. “This is a significant gesture as the BCCEI does not receive any grants or subsidies from the government and its only source of income is through the administration and dispute levies which are received from registered companies in the civil engineering industry. “These levies are used for the running and day-to-day operations of this bargaining council,” explains BCCEI general secretary Nick Faasen. He adds that budgets and cash flow are under immense pressure following the declaration of the National State of Disaster and the subsequent implementation of the nationwide lockdown, which was further extended. “We acknowledge that many people in our sector will, in all probability, have a reduced income and we believe it is essential that we work together to find ways to reduce expenses, wherever possible,” Faasen says. The BCCEI, representing two unions and two employer organisations, provides a range of valuable services to the civil engineering sector. Currently, the council continues to operate through non-contact methods and remains committed to prompt service delivery to the industry.
