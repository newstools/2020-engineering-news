South Africa’s average dam levels are now at 70.4% full, with Gauteng’s dams increasing to 100.5%, followed by Northern Cape and the Free State at 98.8% and 83% respectively. The average dam level in the Western Cape is lagging behind at 37.3%; however, with winter rains expected at the end of May, this was set to change. “The North West is virtually out of the woods following the rise of dam levels from 47% in December last year to 70.9% this week. So is Limpopo, whose dam levels soared from below half three months ago to 68.3% recently,” the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) commented. KwaZulu-Natal’s dam levels remain stagnant at 62.7%. “The volume of water will be enough to sustain the country through the dry winter season until the next summer rains,” the DWS said in a statement on May 6. The average dam levels in Mpumalanga declined slightly from 75.7% last week to 75.6% this week, while the levels in the Eastern Cape, which has been plagued by a severe drought, are making “steady progress” with its dams hovering at 57.4% this week.
