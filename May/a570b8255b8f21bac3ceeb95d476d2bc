Angolan fixed wing and rotary aircraft operator Bestfly has secured a three-year contract to support oil and gas company ExxonMobil’s requirements to ferry staff from Luanda to its main oil logistics base at Soyo. The contract includes the option of a two-year extension. “We faced tough local and international competition to win this tender after very detailed audits by ExxonMobil,” says Bestfly CE Nuno Pereira. Bestfly will use one of its ATR 72-600 turboprops, which can carry 70 passengers for the 45-minute flight, four times a week. “The ATR is ideal for this mission. We have already been serving all of the international oil and gas companies with their repatriation plans during the Covid-19 outbreak and we have had our whole fleet available to give support to get people home,” Pereira points out. Bestfly has a fleet of 21 aircraft ranging from AW139 helicopters to Gulfstream business jets. The company’s two ATR 72-600s were ordered at the 2019 Paris Air Show and entered service in Angola in January. “Oil and gas business is the reason we selected the ATR in the first place,” says Pereira. In addition to the corporate shuttle flights, Bestfly will also use the aircraft to support mining operations in Angola.
