The Department of Employment and Labour reports that, as at May 8, the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), has disbursed about R9.47-billion through the Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS), benefitting 1.94-million workers. Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi says this is a critical infusion and further creates a safety net for workers who may ordinarily not be paid because of the lockdown as a result of Covid-19. “We serve the people of this country and it is particularly at this point that we demonstrate the nature of caring government, thus ensuring that, to the extent possible, no person is left behind.” He adds that this intervention should be seen as part of the government-wide effort to mitigate the worst effects of the pandemic. Prudent investments by the UIF enabled it to meet its obligations despite revenue falling by over R400-million as a result of decreased contributions. Nxesi appeals to employers to make the necessary applications, providing the fund with more information in situations where it has sent queries and to pay the workers the money due to them. A total of 619 365 workers are still to be paid more than R2.6-billion pending the submission of correct information requested by the UIF.
