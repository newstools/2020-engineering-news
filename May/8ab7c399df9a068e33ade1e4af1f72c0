Zimbabwe will receive a $13.7-million grant from the African Development Bank (AfDB) to bolster its health system in the fight against the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The grant will strengthen support for frontline responders and health personnel and boost the country’s Global Health Security Index. The grant will be utilised under Zimbabwe’s Covid-19 Response Project (CRP) and targets 15 high-density suburbs in Harare, satellite townships and health facilities in other parts of the country and will boost capacity in prevention and management protocols including more handwashing facilities. The project will be carried out by the World Health Organisation and Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Health and Child Care will act as executing agency. The CRP is expected to directly benefit over 680 000 people. The CRP will provide Covid-19 medical equipment, laboratory test kits, personal protective equipment, handwashing facilities through the rehabilitation or construction of boreholes, and training of healthcare personnel and laboratory technicians at a community level. Zimbabwe has already introduced a national lockdown which has closed schools, restricted the movement of people, restricted business operating times and the closure of pubs, restaurants and churches. Public gatherings have been limited to 50 people.
