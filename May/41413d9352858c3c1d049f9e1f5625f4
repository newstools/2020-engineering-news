Local face mask manufacturer Aeris Mask has launched a new patent pending mask design for existing cloth masks, which feature a filter insert incorporating porous copper materials that it says provide antiviral properties. Aeris is a subsidiary of Somerset West-based energy research and development firm Elektron Energy. The Aeris copper filter insert is a multi-layer copper-containing filter for cloth masks. It can be used in any cloth mask as an intermediary layer between multiple fabric layers. An in-house designed mask is also available. “With our face mask [facility] starting higher volume production by the end of the second week of May, we will be able to put more advanced, reusable, washable, masks in the hands of our essential workers and those returning back to work,” Aeris co-founder Neill Human notes.
