State-owned Transnet National Ports Authority reports that construction work on current infrastructure projects within South Africa’s ports will not resume under Alert Level 4. It says that, while there has been no indication of when the prohibition on general construction will be lifted, it will communicate updates as amendments to relevant government regulations are issued. The company also points out that government’s Alert Level 4 regulations refer to reactivation of only specific construction activities, including civil engineering and construction for public works projects (including water, energy and sanitation), road and bridge projects, including local road repairs, and critical maintenance and repairs.
