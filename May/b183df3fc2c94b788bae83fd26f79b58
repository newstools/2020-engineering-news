Consumer uncertainty is one of the greatest barriers facing the travel industry, and 70% of South African respondents in a recent survey by data analytics and consulting company GlobalData say they are still extremely concerned about the impact of Covid-19. In addition, 74% believe that conditions will worsen over the next six months. This highlights the extent of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic in the country, which is bad news for the country’s travel industry. “As the signs of domestic recovery take place in China, all destinations aspire for similar circumstances. The South African tourism industry has pinned hopes on the eventual return to domestic travel, as South Africans took 15.6-million domestic trips in 2019,” says GlobalData Travel and Tourism analyst Johanna Bonhill-Smith.
