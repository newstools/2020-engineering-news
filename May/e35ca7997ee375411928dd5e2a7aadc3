Carrier, cloud colocation and data centre services company Teraco on May 6 announced that it was building a second Teraco Cape Town (CT2) data centre facility. Driving this investment is the growth of cloud in the region, resulting in increased demand from cloud providers, enterprises and subsea cable operators seeking to locate their data centre infrastructure at the intersection of the Internet, says Teraco CEO Jan Hnizdo. “Proximity to the cloud, ecosystems and the consumer market is vital in new digital architecture as enterprises move their applications into the cloud and transform their businesses. "Teraco is standing by its 2019 commitment to support the South African government’s investment drive and, with this build, will be investing billions of rands in South Africa’s digital infrastructure. We are investing and will continue to invest in the region," he says. Construction on the CT2 site started in early March and will continue in line with local Covid-19 restrictions, with a targeted completion date of the third quarter of 2021. The completed facility will comprise eight data halls, encompassing 8000 m2 of usable floor space, doubling the existing data centre capacity in the Cape Town region. The investment in CT2 follows the announcement by the company of the expansion of its Johannesburg data centre campus in Isando and the CT2 investment will make the Cape Town facility the second-largest on the continent. Teraco launched its first data centre facility, located in Rondebosch, in Cape Town, CT1, eleven years ago. “This new investment in the Mother City is special for us. To date, CT1 has seen four expansions since launching. This building has sufficient capacity until the new site is brought to market.”
