A press statement issued this week, which suggests that South African Airways (SAA) will resume domestic services by mid-June, is “incorrect” and in violation of SAA’s business rescue practitioners’ (BRP’s) communications protocol. The protocol was put in place to ensure that unvetted releases are not issued. In a statement on May 27, the BRPs noted that the position around the cessation of flights would remain as is until SAA has a better sense of what the Level 3 lockdown means in terms of domestic air travel. The airline also needs to consider what the opening up of the skies will mean from a commercial and load factor perspective, and the airline’s future funding also remains a key variable in all of the above considerations. “It is unfortunate that the unvetted press statement created an unfair expectation on our relevant stakeholders, including SAA’s customers, as well as employees, who are on unpaid [leave] as a result of the travel ban which led to the halting of the company’s operations and compounded its financial distress,” the BRPs lamented. The BRP's focus is on the publication of a business rescue plan as outlined in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts update on May 15.
