The South African Paint Manufacturing Association (Sapma) urges the government to allow paint contractors to not only carry out emergency projects, but also other contracts for external surface renovations and coatings. In terms of Level 4 stipulations, paint producers and coatings raw material suppliers, as well as paint retailers, were allowed to reopen on May 4 but only to carry out emergency projects. In an appeal to Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel, Sapma executive director Deryck Spence notes that the South African interior’s dryer season in autumn and winter normally provide substantial opportunity for paint and waterproofing contractors to handle far more contracts than during the inland wet summers. He explains that autumn and winter are the ideal seasons for contractors to reopen their business for external work, and can undertake such work with reduced contact to home-owners. This will enable paint contractors to re-employ their workers, most of whom have not been paid since the lockdown started at the end of March. “This concession will assist thousands of households, as well as aid the economy during these difficult times,” says Spence, who assured in his appeal that all such operations would be in accordance with the Covid-19 guidelines prescribed by government. Sapma stresses that paint contractors will ensure that the mandatory personal protective equipment and clothing is worn and that businesses will be monitored to ensure compliance.
