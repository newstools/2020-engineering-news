The Road Freight Association (RFA) is urging government to open up all sectors of the economy to “lessen the already devastating economic impact of the lockdown and Covid-19”. “The movement of both goods and people is vital for the wheels of South Africa’s economy to keep turning,” says RFA CEO Gavin Kelly. “We urge government to allow the transport and logistics industry and all its sub-sectors to operate fully, with immediate effect. If this does not happen soon, it is going to be even harder for our already weak and ailing economy to recover.” Kelly adds that, with the ongoing restriction on the movement of some goods, many road freight operators are operating in a non-sustainable manner, delivering minimal loads, but still incurring all the operational costs such as on staff, vehicle costs and fuel. “This is simply business suicide and cannot continue.” Kelly also reports that storage may soon become a challenge, with many warehouses now filled to capacity. “We call on government to open up the economy in a swift and responsible manner.” The RFA has developed a Road Freight Industry Protocol for Covid-19 that is currently used by transporters moving essential goods, he adds. “This has proved to be highly effective. “We need to boost economic activity as a matter of urgency. Without trucks, South Africa stops.”
