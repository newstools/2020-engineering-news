Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, national federation the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) has moved its sixth Annual Excellence Awards ceremony from May 28 to July 23. The postponement of the ceremony has also resulted in Seifsa extending the deadline for the submission of entries to July 10. “We realise that our sector has been adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and that companies are currently trying to navigate their way through the tough economic conditions. It is for this reason that we have decided to give them more time to prepare and submit their entries,” Seifsa CEO Kaizer Nyatsumba said. Manufacturers operating in the metals and engineering sector now have two more months to submit their entries for the seven award categories. Awards entrants will be assessed on their performance in the period July 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. Seifsa will present awards in the following categories: The Most Innovative Company of the Year Award; The Most Transformed Company of the Year Award; The Health and Safety of the Year Award; The Artisan Development of the Year; The Environmental Stewardship of the Year Award; and The Customer Service of the Year Award. Entries are also invited from companies whose corporate social investment programme/s between July 2018 and December 2019 had a major impact on the lives of their beneficiaries. Entries are open to members of associations federated to Seifsa as well as non-members.
