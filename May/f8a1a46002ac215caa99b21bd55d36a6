Subject to certain ongoing Covid-19-related restrictions and safety measures, AB Impianti has resumed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) operations, which will increase over the coming months, for the 5 MW Bordersley gas-fuelled power generation plant in the UK. Bordersley is a subsidiary of Africa-focussed Kibo Energy, and the plant is currently being developed for Kibo by the company’s 60%-owned subsidiary, manager and operator of Bordersley, Mast Energy Developments (MED). The completion of the EPC scope of works, which was temporarily delayed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, has been resumed as a priority matter and MED and AB continue to progress activity. MED’s discussions with regard to securing substantial financing is ongoing, which could enable it to embark on a portfolio development strategy and implementation, which will see the simultaneous development of more than 20 sites from its prospective “shovel ready” portfolio of sustainable power generation assets in the UK. MED is also in active discussions with the suppliers of “shovel ready” sites in aggregate of 300 MW in order to bolster its projects portfolio pipeline. CEO Louis Coetzee says the work programme will be advanced as a matter of priority so that construction and commissioning can start at Bordersley as soon as possible.
