The Gautrain will not be increasing its fares in June this year, as would normally have been the case. Instead, the Gautrain Management Agency and Bombela Concession Company will be delaying the fare increase to later in the year once more accurate information is available as to when the lockdown regulations in South Africa will be lifted. In a statement on May 13, the rapid-rail system said the decision to delay the increase was owing to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown regulations, alongside South Africaâ€™s current economic situation. In accordance with the Gautrain Concession Agreement, Gautrain fares are adjusted yearly in June. The annual fare increase is guided by the Consumer Price Index. Gautrain resumed a reduced service on May 4 after the system was closed during Level 5 of the national lockdown.
