Between May 18 and July 24 State-owned Transnet’s ‘clinic on wheels’ will roll out across KwaZulu-Natal to increase the screening and testing capabilities in the province. Transnet’s Phelophepa II train arrived in the Phoenix township on Monday and will visit communities in Empangeni, Ulundi, Pietermaritzburg and Port Shepstone. The Phelophepa train I and II are designed to provide basic medical help and education and form part of an agreement between Transnet and the Departments of Health in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape. Only screening and testing for Covid-19 will take place on-board the train. The Phelophepa I train arrived in Stutterheim, in the Eastern Cape last week, and was expected to leave for the next station, Mount Ruth, later this week. “The Department of Health in both provinces will handle all activities associated with the screening and testing for Covid-19 and will be responsible for the welfare of the healthcare staff, administrative staff and all equipment required for screening,” said Transnet. Transnet will provide the connection points for water and electricity from the health train and will also manage personnel for the movement and the staging of the train, and security services including crowd control.
