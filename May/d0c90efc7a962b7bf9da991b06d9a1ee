The Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) is calling for expressions of interest (EoI) to be submitted for two new telecommunications licences in Ethiopia. Interested parties have until 12:00 GMT+3 on June 22 to submit their interest for the potential awarding of two nationwide telecommunications service licences, ECA said in a statement on May 22. ECA is managing the licence issuance process, with the two qualified telecommunications companies set to be selected through a competitive bidding process in accordance with Communications Service Proclamation No. 1148/2019. The issuance of the two new licences to telecommunications companies will be in addition to the existing licence held by Ethio Telecom. The significant milestone forms part of Ethiopia’s Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda to introduce competition into the sector. “The primary goals of the government are to increase access to reliable and efficient communications services for all Ethiopians, leading to improvements in quality of life and in connectivity to support rapid economic transformation, and to maximize the opportunity presented by the digital economy,” the ECA said. ECA was established in August 2019, with a number of important steps taken since November 2019, including hiring the International Finance Corporation as a transaction adviser and the drafting of numerous directives that will shape a robust legal and regulatory framework. Ethiopia remains committed to opening up the telecommunications sector and unlocking the transformational power of the digital economy.
