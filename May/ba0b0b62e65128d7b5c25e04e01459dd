Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel and representatives from the retail - clothing, textile, footwear and leather (R-CTFL) sector will develop a common framework for the implementation of Covid-19-ready workplaces that can serve as a guide for the industry. The agreement follows as the recent move to Level 4 restrictions has seen greater parts of the retail and manufacturing value chain open up. Level 4 enables manufacturers to begin manufacturing with at least 30% normal employment for all clothing, textile, footwear and leather goods; up to 50% for winter goods; and up to 100% for children’s and baby clothes, and personal protective equipment like face masks. The CTFL sector representatives have agreed to form a working group to provide policy inputs and practical evaluations to government as the Covid-19 terrain is navigated, and as such, details of the R-CTFL Covid-19 framework will be released in the coming days. During the meeting earlier this week, Patel, retail CEOs, manufacturers and labour representatives engaged on matters that could be covered in the framework agreement for the industry to protect employees in manufacturing and retail, as well as customers in retail stores. Retail CEOs also provided the meeting with feedback on the reopening of stores and measures they have taken to manage the return to work. The industry now has more than 350 manufacturers who have indicated that they are ready to produce cloth facemasks, ranging from microenterprises employing a few people, to small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as larger firms. Proposals were also heard on the phasing in of shift workers, physical distancing for employees and customers and other necessary health protocols, to avoid a sudden increase in the spread of Covid-19 now that more parts of the retail and manufacturing sectors are opening up. The Minister commented that, as South Africa navigates the uncharted terrain of the Covid-19 reality, “it will take our collective efforts to ensure we reduce risks of infection while we reopen our economy and adjust to our new normal”.
