Petrochemicals and chemicals manufacturer Sasol reports that it has opened entries for small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs) in the manufacturing, engineering services and recyclables sectors to join its Sasol Business Accelerator (SBA) programme. Interested companies must be based in Sasolburg, in the Free State, and surrounding areas, including the Metsimaholo, Ngwate and Emfuleni municipalities. Successful applications will be housed at the Sasol business incubator facility in Eco-industrial Park in Sasolburg. The facility is equipped and structured to enable and host a diverse mix of SMMEs for development, service providers and stakeholders that can support one another, as well as other businesses in the area. Sasol enterprise and supplier manager Ofentse Tiro says the key intention of the programme is to help grow these businesses into significant entities that can provide quality services to compete for opportunities within Sasol’s supply chain as well as that of other companies. “To ensure we do justice to this process, we have also appointed an independent third-party company called Zevoli to assist with the selection and screening of potential candidates for the programme.” The SMMEs at the Sasol incubation facilities, from where the SBA programme will be run, will also have access to four 500 m2 well-equipped workshops for manufacturing and engineering-related work, and a 2 000 m2 double-storey main office building, which encompasses four conference facilities, meeting and training venues, an entertainment area, hot desking facilities and office space for predominantly service-related enterprises. The closing date for applications is June 17.
