State-owned national flag carrier South African Airways (SAA) has assured that it had no plans to stop operating on May 8. It would continue to honour all its current commitments to provide air transport services to its customers, as well as any other requests that it might receive. It continued to receive, and act on, requests from foreign governments, who still had citizens stranded in South Africa. It would continue to operate repatriation and cargo flights throughout this month and beyond it, as long as it received such requests. “We are in ongoing discussions with the Departments of Public Enterprises and that of International Relations and Cooperation, regarding other destinations where South African citizens may be stranded,” reported SAA interim executive chairperson Thandeka Mgoduso. “Further, we are responding proactively in those instances where there is a need for essential humanitarian cargo for our country and for the neighbouring States to be uplifted.” SAA had transported more than 9 100 people to six continents since April 3. It had also carried 870 t of cargo, both export and import, including critical humanitarian cargo.
