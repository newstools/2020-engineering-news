The Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) has appointed sustainability expert Lisa Reynolds CEO, effective June 1. Reynolds co-founded the Green Building Design Group, previously served as executive of sustainable development at Saint-Gobain and chaired the South African National Standards’ Energy Efficiency Standards in Buildings initiative. She was also president of the Southern African Energy Efficiency Confederation. “In this time of Covid-19, as we emerge from lockdown, we must establish a strategy of green recovery and local value-added solutions. The effect of climate change remains one of our biggest challenges. Healthier, resource efficient buildings and places are vital,” Reynolds says.
