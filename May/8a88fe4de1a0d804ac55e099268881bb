ViroGOLDSchool, a range of hypochlorous acid products developed specifically for schools, has launched a back-to-school label design competition and is calling on learners from across the country to participate and stand a chance to win cash for themselves and products for their schools. CanbiGold Marketing’s Debra Buys says the company “wants to offer learners the opportunity to express themselves artistically by designing a new label” for the product, which has been designed specifically with schools in mind. “We hope it will inspire them to show how they see our anti-viral and anti-bacterial product in light of Covid-19. It promises to be a fun activity to do at home before schools re-open, teach them about disinfectants and why it’s so important to stay clean and safe.” The competition will have three categories, namely pre-school, primary school and high school and a panel of judges from CanbiGold will select the winner and two runners-up in each category, as well as the overall champion. The competition closes on June 29. ViroGOLD School Sanitiser can be used on all surfaces and equipment, as well as learners’ hands and masks. The product contains hypochlorous acid, a US Food and Drug Administration- (FDA-) approved disinfectant scientifically proven to kill both viruses and bacteria on all surfaces. It was added to the list of disinfectants for use against the Covid-19 virus, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US in March this year. “With children [expected to] return to school, it’s very important that these areas are sanitised to avoid the further spread of the virus. Hypochlorous acid has proven to be more effective than most products currently on the market in the fight against Covid-19, as well as being more affordable,” says CanbiGold's Leon van der Linde.
