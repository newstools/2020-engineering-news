Since the start of South Africa’s national lockdown in March, the Port of Mossel Bay has been playing a critical role in the provision of essential services – with special emphasis on the fishing and oil and gas sectors, says Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA). Despite the uncertain times, the port has successfully handled seven liquid bulk vessels collectively carrying 168 587 kilolitres of liquid bulk cargo and 13 break bulk vessels carrying 908 t of cargo. Mossel Bay port manager Shadrack Tshikalange said that the handling of vessels during this period not only indicates the level of confidence that vessel and cargo owners and other role players have in the port’s capabilities, but also indicates the port’s commitment towards ensuring that the South African economy survives the Covid-19 pandemic. Fishing operations, which form part of break bulk commodities at the port, are among South Africa’s critical business continuity services aimed at ensuring food security for all citizens. “To this end, the port will continue to show unwavering support of all logistics operations related to the provision of food as a necessity during the pandemic. Port tenants who are in the fishing industry are following guidelines outlined in the Disaster Management Act and the port is in full support of their entire value chain,” says Tshikalange. The port’s performance is in line with its value proposition, which is focused on meeting customer demand with exceptional performance as it serves the petroleum, fishing and tourism industries in support of sustained economic development in one of the most pristine environments in Africa. “Continued operations during the lockdown could not have been achieved without the selflessness, commitment and passion of departments such as the office of the harbour master, [as well as] marine, finance, operations, safety, health, environment, procurement and security [personnel],” Tshikalange highlights.
