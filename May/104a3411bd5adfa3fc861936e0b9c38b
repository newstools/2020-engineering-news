The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is calling on citizens to save water as the average water levels of dams within the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) deteriorate. The system has experienced a decline from 67.6% last week to 67.3% this week, compared with the 74.1% in the same week last year. The department warned on May 28 that the water levels of the Vaal dam had fallen below the 50% mark, with a persistent week-on-week decline. “Presently hovering at 49.8%, the dam is significantly lower compared with the level of 71.5% it recorded at the same week last year. Last week the dam was sitting at 50.6%,” the DWS said in a statement, Similarly, the other dams forming part of the IVRS are recording declines. The average levels of the Grootdraai dam contracted from 89% last week to 87.8% this week, while the Katse and Mohale dams continue to decline at “alarming levels”. “The Mohale dam deteriorated this week, moving from last week’s 14.4% to 13.6% this week. In the preceding year at the same week the dam was at 33.3%, indicating it has consistently remained in an unfavourable position for a number of months now.” The Katse dam, which has also shown no improvement in levels for months, fell from 37.6% last week to 37.2% this week. “Given the weekly drop in the levels of the Vaal dam and other dams in the system, the DWS urges water users to reduce their consumption to a bare minimum,” the department said, pointing out that the country is moving towards the dry winter season which will see less rainfall.
