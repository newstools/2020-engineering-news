In response to the increased demand for home connectivity during the Covid-19 lockdown in South Africa, Telkom is reducing prices and removing caps on its copper-based digital subscriber line (DSL) broadband portfolio to new customers. The promotional prices, starting from R199 for an initial six-month period, are aimed at enabling access for those who currently do not have fixed broadband. This pricing of the uncapped data is part of Telkom’s Covid-19 relief efforts to enable access to education, work and entertainment platforms. Telkom product development and management executive Steven White says Telkom already has copper access technology which can provide cost effective home connectivity. “During the lockdown we decided to use all the infrastructure available to us to provide good,  affordable quality broadband.” He says Telkom will also be reducing the price of its existing unlimited home bundles that include a voice calling plan as well as mobile data. “This product will be offered to new and existing customers who will receive the further benefit of higher speeds.” Telkom will move existing customers on capped DSL services to unlimited home services to offer them better value; ensuring that loyal customers are not left behind. Telkom’s DSL promotional price for a 4 Mb/s UnlimitedHome Lite package is R199 a month for the first six months. Thereafter it will cost R329 a month.
