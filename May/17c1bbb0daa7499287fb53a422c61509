The Covid-19 loan guarantee scheme announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa in April is operational as of May 12. The initial set of participating banks − Absa, First National Bank, Investec, Mercantile Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank − are ready to accept loan applications from distressed businesses which bank with them. The activation of the loan guarantee scheme follows the finalisation of legal details by the National Treasury, the South African Reserve Bank and the Banking Association South Africa. The scheme is an initiative to provide loans, guaranteed by government, to businesses with a yearly turnover of less than R300-million to meet some of their operational expenses. Funds borrowed through this scheme can be used for operational expenses such as salaries, rent and lease agreements and contracts with suppliers, for example. Government and commercial banks are sharing the risk of these loans. Initially, the National Treasury has provided a guarantee of R100-billion for this scheme, with the option to increase the guarantee to R200-billion if necessary and if the scheme is deemed successful. Those with enquiries are advised to direct these to the individual banks, which are administering the scheme.
