Engineering consultant EPCM Bonisana, a subsidiary of EPCM Holdings, plans to remobilise on June 1 for the restart of construction of the pipeline at emerging domestic natural gas and helium producer Renergen’s Virgina gas project, in the Free State. “This is a great result, not only for Renergen but also for the number of people locally that will be employed in due course particularly in light of the massive negative consequences Covid-19 has had on many people’s livelihoods,” Renergen CEO Stefano Marani said in a May 28 release.
