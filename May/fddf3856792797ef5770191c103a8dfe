Manufacturer Wolf Oil Corporation and vehicle spare parts supplier Goldwagen have entered into a new partnership that will see Wolf Lubricants products being distributed exclusively by Goldwagen’s retail outlets throughout Southern African markets, including South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana. Wolf Oil area sales manager Frédérico Alves says the partnership will add a “considerable presence” to Wolf Lubricants in Africa. The two companies, which are both part of the Nexus international automotive community, entered into the supply agreement in the second half of 2019.
