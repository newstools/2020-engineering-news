The Competition Commission has referred cases against two major protective face mask suppliers to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. Sicuro Safety and Hennox Supplies are said to have allegedly charged excessive prices for face masks, with the commission saying prices had increased “astronomically” by more than 969.07% and 956%, as charged by Sicuro and Hennox, respectively. The commission says the firms have not furnished it with any reasonable explanation for the alleged excessive price increases. The commission contends that Sicuro’s and Hennox’s pricing was a direct reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic and its unprecedented impact on the world in general, and South Africa in particular.
