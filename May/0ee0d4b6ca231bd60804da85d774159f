President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Wednesday convene his third meeting with leaders of South Africa’s political parties represented in Parliament to discuss the national response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. In an effort to be inclusive, Ramaphosa has held meetings and consultations with leaders across various sectors of society since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. In March, Ramaphosa met with political party leaders to discuss the pandemic’s impact on businesses and the economy, and sought recommendations to mitigate the impact of Covid-19.
