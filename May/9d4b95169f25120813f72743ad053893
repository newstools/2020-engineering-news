This year's Sasol Solar Challenge (SSC) has been postponed until early 2021. The solar car racing event is provisionally scheduled to take place from February 19 to February 26, instead of September this year as initially planned, say the organisers. Participating teams will be able to register until the end of November. A new date for the South African launch and local testing event originally scheduled for June this year will depend on guidance from the South African government, and will be announced once confirmed. This postponement is a natural consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, say the race organisers. “It is clear that restrictions on movement will remain in some form until the end of 2020, and the SSC and its sponsors continue to support government efforts and regulations to mitigate the impact of the disease. “We also recognise that the SSC requires extensive technology development, production and research, not to mention logistics preparation from more than a dozen teams around the world. The event will, therefore, not take place this year, regardless of South Africa’s lockdown status.” “We are postponing the 2020 Sasol Solar Challenge out of concern for the wellbeing of participants and spectators, and in recognition of the challenges faced by teams around the world in working on their solar cars,” notes SCC owner and director Robert Walker. “We strongly believe that through continued collaboration, communication and support we can retain the enthusiasm and spirit that makes this such a unique event, and are committed to maintaining our momentum until we are once again able to welcome all participants to South African roads.”
