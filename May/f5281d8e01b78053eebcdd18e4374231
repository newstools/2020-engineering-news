Following the success of its online portal dedicated to matching supply and demand of locally manufactured fabric face masks, national campaign Proudly SA has extended the portal to include local producers of hand sanitiser, surface disinfectants and detergents. As South Africans gradually return to the workplace, the need for a reliable and local source of products that comply with proper health and safety standards is expected to spike and to last throughout the entire lockdown period, up to and beyond Stage 1. The fabric masks portal, which was set up with the assistance of the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union, the National Bargaining Council for Clothing Manufacturers and the Manufacturing Circle, has established an online listing of accredited mask producers where buyers can source masks that meet their specific requirements. In the same way, the extended pages will list only local manufacturers of sanitisers, disinfectants and detergents that have been tested and which adhere to industry standards and labelling legislation. Production capacities and contact details are supplied and corporate and individual buyers can make direct contact with the listed companies. The portal can be accessed on Proudly SA’s website. The organisation encouraged local manufacturers of sanitiser, detergents and disinfectants to register their businesses at https://bit.ly/rsa_ppe_reg.
