The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has appointed Krishna Govender as CFO, effective immediately. Govender is a chartered accountant and has almost 25 years’ experience in accounting and financial management, which he gained at various entities in both the public and private sectors. Currently, he is part of the technical advisory team to PRASA administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo, as well as chairperson of the revenue enhancement and cost containment subcommittee of the PRASA group executive committee. Govender has been tasked to reduce the State-owned public transport operator’s budget deficit. The rail agency has over the past few years presented an unfunded budget, wherein projected expenses exceeded expected income. Further, his immediate tasks will include improving PRASA’s finance policy deficiencies, finance systems and controls, document management system for group finance and turnaround times. Govender succeeds Lesibana Fosu. Mpondo comments that he expects to see great improvement in the group finance department and that he can already see how some of Govender’s interventions as the revenue enhancement chair have been fruitful.
