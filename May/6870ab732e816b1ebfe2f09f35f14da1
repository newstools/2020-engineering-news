Organisers of Southern Africa’s mining, manufacturing, automation, electrical and power trade exhibition Electra Mining Africa, Specialised Exhibitions, reports that the 2020 edition of the trade fair has been cancelled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This year’s show had been scheduled to take place from September 7 to 11 in Johannesburg. The next edition of the trade fair will now be held from September 5 to 9, 2022. The lockdown imposed in South Africa to help curb the spread of Covid-19 prohibits large gatherings and restrictions on local and international travel. “Although disappointed that the 2020 show will not go ahead, it is the right decision for all stakeholders involved. We fully support the measures taken by government. The safety and wellbeing of our exhibitors, suppliers, visitors and the industry as a whole continues to be of paramount importance to us,” says Specialised Exhibitions MD Gary Corin. Specialised Exhibitions portfolio director Charlene Hefer says exhibitions post Covid-19 will play an essential role in providing a fast-track to economic recovery. “They will enable the all-important face-to-face connection between buyers and sellers, bring new products to market, drive innovation, forge partnerships, build brands and community, offer immersive experiences and provide intellectual content and educational opportunities through seminars and workshops.” She notes that the company has some exciting new ideas and innovative plans for more value-add show features, and that having extra time will enable it to put these in place. “These will be in addition to our popular ‘every-day-a-themed-day’ experience, industry conferences, free-to-attend seminars, skills development zone, inward buying mission, business match-making and live demonstrations.”
