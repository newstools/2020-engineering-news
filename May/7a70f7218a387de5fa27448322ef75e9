From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. AECI has established a ‘filling station’ for the City of Tshwane to supply 40 000 ℓ of safe drinking water to the water-stressed Hammanskraal community amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The initiative, which directly benefits 800 households and 5 000 people, will leverage an established AECI-sponsored borehole at the Phalesane Primary School. That’s Creamer Media’s Real Economy Report. Join us again next week for more news and insight into South Africa’s real economy.
