Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) has reported an incident whereby a mobile harbour crane caught fire at the Durban terminal, early on the morning of May 20. No injuries were sustained and the crane operator was safely evacuated from the machine. A nearby vessel was also safely moved. Management members of the terminal have addressed the employees that were on shift and they will be offered counselling services through Transnet’s employment assistance programme. Operations have been stopped at the terminal to allow for clearing of the site. TPT will shortly start with an incident investigation to determine the cause of the fire, as well as the extent of the damage caused. Additionally, the terminal has activated a business continuity plan to minimise the impact on operations and continues to engage with customers. The Durban terminal is one of the 19 terminals managed by TPT.
