Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has appointed Advocate Terry Motau to lead a team of lawyers to review all fraud, corruption and irregular expenditure reports at the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and to ensure that all recommendations are fully implemented. With a lack of consequence management in the DWS, many officials implicated in fraud and corruption remain at work or are suspended with pay. “I have directed Motau and a team that he is going to be working with that l want all reports on fraud, corruption and irregular expenditure of the department and all water boards to be reviewed and all recommendations implemented. Officials and service providers involved in corruption must face the consequences,” Sisulu said. “I received a report that more than R16-billion worth of projects has been issued irregularly, including blanket corruption and fraud by officials, to an extent of awarding tenders to themselves and close relatives,” she continued. Motau has been involved in a number of high-profile investigations, including the “Great Bank Heist” which focused on corruption and looting at VBS Bank, in Limpopo. Sisulu concluded that Motau has the necessary experience and will lead a team of professionals to make sure that in the water sector there is consequence management and value for money.
