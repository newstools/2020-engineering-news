The Competition Tribunal has approved two more consent agreements with a company accused by the Competition Commission of charging excessive prices for essential products. The Van Heerden Pharmacy Group has agreed to pay a R30 000 settlement and to make a further donation to the national Solidarity Fund. The R30 000 settlement is applicable to the Nelspruit branch and the Solidarity Fund donation to the Pretoria branch. This was agreed to in two separate consent agreements with the commission. The pharmacy has also agreed to reduce its gross profit margins for these essential products for the duration of the state of national disaster.
