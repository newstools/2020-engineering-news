The Competition Commission has referred to the Competition Tribunal for confirmation a consent agreement with corrugated box packaging company Mpact in respect of alleged acts of collusion and prior implementation of merger acquisitions in contravention of the Competition Act. In terms of the agreement, Mpact has undertaken to pay a penalty of R7-million. The agreement follows an investigation initiated by the commissioner in May 2016 after Mpact, through its indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary Rebel Packaging, acquired control of several entities, allegedly without approval from the commission. In terms of the Competition Act, these acquisitions were notifiable mergers, meaning that they were supposed to be reported to the commission prior to implementation. The commission says Mpact has since admitted that this conduct contravened the Act. In the course of its investigation, the commission also found that Mpact, together with a number of smaller entities, was allegedly involved in collusive conduct relating to price fixing, collusive tendering and division of markets in the market for the manufacture and supply of corrugated packaging products. The commission also found that, after the mergers, Mpact, through its involvement as shareholder and supplier to the sheet plants over which it gained control, allegedly had insight into their costs and pricing, as well as the specific customers whom they were targeting. Mpact also had a representative who sat on the board of directors of those sheet plants, the commission alleged. The commission referred the matter to the tribunal in April 2019. It added that this settlement resolved all issues in relation to the prior implementation of Mpact’s merger acquisitions and its alleged acts of collusion in contravention of the Act.
