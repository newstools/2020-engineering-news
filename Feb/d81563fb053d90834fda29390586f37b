Eskom says stage 2 rotational load-shedding will continue until Friday, with a "high probability of cuts" over the weekend. 

The cuts are due to a shortage of capacity and a higher demand for electricity. The utility said it would not be able to suspend cuts for morning or afternoon peak traffic. It would, however, continue to "explore the pilot programme of providing load shedding respite". The utility reiterated there is an increased possibility of load shedding over the next 18 months as conducts critical maintenance. It asked consumers to assist in reducing the probability of load-shedding by using electricity sparingly.
 
"We don't take the decision to implement load-shedding lightly, but the reality is that our generating infrastructure is constrained and unreliable," said Eskom group CEO André de Ruyter. "It is regrettable for us to have to implement load-shedding, but it is unavoidable given the state of the generation infrastructure, as well as unusually high demand. Load-shedding is necessary to protect the power system as we conduct critical maintenance and to replenish emergency reserves."
