Emerging domestic natural gas and helium producer Renergen’s subsidiary, Tetra4, has secured an agreement with Bulk Hauliers International Transport (BHIT) for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Virginia gas project, in the Free State. The LNG will be used to fuel about 50 of BHIT’s trucks, meaning that operator costs and the vehicle lifecycle maintenance costs will be significantly reduced. Renergen CEO Stefano Marani says Tetra4 “is proud to be associated with BHIT as they embark on their new venture to disrupt the local logistics market using cutting-edge technology and international best practice”. BHIT director James Cohen adds that BHIT is committed to providing “sustainable transport solutions” and that running its trucks on locally produced LNG “fits in perfectly” with this goal. BHIT operates a premium fleet of truck-tractor combinations, with a focus on the transportation of general freight and dangerous goods throughout Southern Africa. Tetra4 holds the first, and currently only, onshore petroleum production licence issued by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy through the Petroleum Agency of South Africa.
