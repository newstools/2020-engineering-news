Eskom says that stage 2 load-shedding will continue until 6 am on Sunday morning due to a loss of additional units. "While we expect three generation units to return to service [on Friday], we lost a further two units last night to unplanned breakdowns," the utility said in an power update. Unplanned outages increased were at 11 562MW on Friday morning, a slight decrease from 12 225MW on Thursday afternoon. The cash-strapped utility has warned of an increased likelihood of power cuts over the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
