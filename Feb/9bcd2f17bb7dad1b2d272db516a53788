Eskom says it will suspend rotational load-shedding between 4pm and 6pm on Monday to "help ease traffic congestion". Power cuts will then resume at 6pm and continue until 6am on Tuesday. "Suspending load-shedding during the peak traffic hours is a pilot programme aimed at achieving an appropriate Load-shedding Philosophy for the country," the utility said in a statement. "As this is not possible everyday, it will be confirmed each day, dependent on the risk based on the available capacity and emergency reserves on the day."

The utility will also try and suspend power cuts between 6am and 9am every morning. Power rationing will continue until Thursday morning at 6am. "We regret that load-shedding has a negative impact on South Africa. Critical maintenance is being done on units that are currently on planned outages as well as some of those on unplanned outages to ensure timeous return to service," it said.
