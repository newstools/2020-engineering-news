The Automobile Association (AA) has said that motorists can expect "substantial fuel price reductions" next month, in part due to falling world oil prices as coronavirus fears impact global economic activity. "The impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on global economic activity cannot be over-stated, and petroleum prices have retreated in lockstep with the downturn across world markets," the AA says. "Under normal circumstances, we would be focusing on our serious concerns over the Rand's trajectory, with the local currency having depreciated by nearly 30 cents against the US dollar since the start of February. However, these declines have all been overrun by the pullback in oil." The Association has forecast month-end fuel price declines of between nine and 19 cents per litre for petrol, 55 cents a litre for diesel, and 68 cents for illuminating paraffin.
