Publicly traded company Anheuser-Busch (AB) InBev on Thursday announced that chief financial and technology officer Felipe Dutra would step down. Fernando Tennenbaum has been appointed CFO. He is a 15-year veteran of the company and presently serves as VP of finance for the company’s South America Zone, as well as chief financial and investor relations officer of its Brazilian subsidiary Ambev. Concurrently, Ambev has announced that Lucas Lira would succeed Tennenbaum as chief financial and investor relations officer, as from April 29. Meanwhile, David Almeida will become AB InBev chief strategy and technology officer and Nelson Jamel chief people officer. They will be part of the company’s senior leadership team (SLT) and will report to CEO Carlos Brito. Tennenbaum will also join the executive committee. As from April 29, AB InBev’s executive committee will be comprised of Brito, Tennenbaum,  Almeida and chief legal and corporate affairs officer John Blood. These changes are part of a well-established succession plan and will be effective after AB InBev’s annual shareholders’ meeting. Dutra will remain with the company during a transition period of several months after the succession is effective. “Felipe’s contributions to our value creation are significant and wide-ranging. He has been the steward of our financial discipline, which has freed up resources to invest behind the organic growth of our business. He has played a key role in the creations of Ambev and InBev, as well as in our landmark combinations with Anheuser-Busch, Grupo Modelo and South African Breweries,” Brito said. “In the last few years, he has also driven the creation of our technology function. Perhaps most importantly, he developed a strong bench of internal talent for both finance and technology as part of his legacy,” he added.
