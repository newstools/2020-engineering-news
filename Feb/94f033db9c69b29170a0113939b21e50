Eskom resumed stage 1 load-shedding at 9am on Monday morning. In a power update, the utility said the cuts are due to a shortage of capacity and the need to replenish emergency supplies. Eskom has not yet said whether cuts would continue for the remainder of the week. It will provide an update on Monday evening. "Our teams are working hard to reduce unplanned outages or breakdowns, which were atÂ 11 015MW as at 07:00 [on Monday]," said Eskom. The utility again noted there will be an increased possibility of load-shedding over the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
