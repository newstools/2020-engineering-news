Eskom says it is not planning to implement power cuts on Monday, after it replenished its emergency reserves of water and diesel over the weekend. This comes after the power utility halted stage 2 load-shedding ahead of schedule at 9 pm on Sunday The prognosis for the week ahead is that the possibility of load-shedding remains, said Eskom in a power alert on Monday morning. The cash-strapped utility has warned of an increased likelihood of power cuts over the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
