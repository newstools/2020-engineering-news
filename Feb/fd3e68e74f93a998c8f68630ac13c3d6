Eskom says it does not expect to have to implement power cuts on Tuesday after additional generation units returned to service overnight. The utility, in a morning power alert, said that the generation system had held up well since Sunday with emergency reserves at adequate levels. "It is important, however, for customers to continue using electricity sparingly and help us curb demand," it said, warning that load-shedding may be implemented at short notice should there be major changes in the performance of the generation system. Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10 559MW in the morning, while planned maintenance is 4 885MW. Eskom has previously said there is an increased risk of load-shedding over the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
