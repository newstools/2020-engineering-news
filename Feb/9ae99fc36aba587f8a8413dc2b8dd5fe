Eskom will continue to implement stage 1 rotational load-shedding until 6 am on Wednesday due to a shortage of capacity and the need to replenish its emergency reserves. This means power cuts will not be suspended between 4 pm and 6 pm on Tuesday during peak traffic. It said it would provide an update on Tuesday evening about its prognosis for Wednesday. "Our teams are working hard to reduce unplanned outages or breakdowns, which were at 11 016MW as at 06:55 this morning," said Eskom. "Critical maintenance continues to be conducted on units that are currently on planned outages." The power utility reminded customers there is an increased likelihood of load shedding over the next 18 months as it conducts critical maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
