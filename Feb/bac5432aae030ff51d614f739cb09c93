Joburg Water has announced that it will intensify its efforts to repair or replace aging and obsolete water infrastructure in Soweto, Orange Farm and Alexandra. This will reduce water losses owing to leaks – the entity lost about 38% of its bulk supply in 2019 owing to damaged infrastructure. The repairs form part of Joburg Water’s Pipes Replacement Programme, which is under way across Johannesburg to substitute all damaged water pipes. Joburg Water has more than 10 000 km of distribution pipes providing water across the city. The entity assures that it will limit supply interruptions for residents when maintenance is conducted.
