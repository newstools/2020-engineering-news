Eskom says it is not planning to implement power cuts on Tuesday. In a power update on Tuesday morning, the power utility said that additional generating units had returned to service and its emergency reserves were at adequate levels. This comes after the power utility halted stage 2 load-shedding ahead of schedule at 9 pm on Sunday, and did not implement load-shedding on Monday. However, it reminded customers that South Africa's power system remains vulnerable and cuts could be implemented at short notice if there are any changes in system performance. It urged consumers to use electricity sparingly. Unplanned outages were at 10 853 MW on Tuesday morning. The cash-strapped utility has warned of an increased likelihood of power cuts over the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power plants.
