Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has extended its congratulations to Lisa Seftel on her appointment as the first female executive director at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). Busa says her appointment is an “excellent choice”, given her previous leadership experience. Seftel recently worked as an executive director for transport in the City of Johannesburg, a position she held for more than a decade. “Business knows Seftel well and we are sure she will be able to ensure Nedlac is properly led and transformed. She can count on the support of Busa as she takes office as a ‘driver’ of Nedlac where government, labour, business and community organisations meet and cooperate, through problem solving and negotiation, on economic, labour and development issues and related challenges facing the country,” the organisation comments. “We look forward to working with her, particularly to restructure and re-mandate Nedlac to play a critical role in social dialogue.”
