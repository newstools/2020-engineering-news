South Africa will fast-track four continent-wide infrastructure projects in which itâ€™s involved, including a $14-billion dam on the Congo river, President Cyril Ramaphosa said as the country assumed the chair of the African Union (AU) in Addis Ababa. The country will drive the Inga III power project alongside the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Botswana and Angola; road and rail infrastructure along the Beitbridge border post, which connects it to neighbouring Zimbabwe and Phase II of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which will increase its supply of water and generate electricity for Lesotho. South Africa will also establish itself as a continental hub for manufacture and supply of rail stock. Ramaphosa also offered to host an international financing investment conference for AU priority projects in South Africa.
