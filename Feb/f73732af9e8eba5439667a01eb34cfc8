Packaging products manufacturer Nampak on Tuesday said the Competition Commission had granted its approval, subject to certain conditions, for the sale of Nampak's Glass business to Isanti Glass 1. Nampak in September last year announced that it would sell the Glass business to Isanti Glass 1, a joint venture between Kwande Capital and Sabsa Holdings, for R1.5-billion. Nampak noted that the disposal remained subject to one outstanding suspensive condition, which relates to the transfer and or issue to the buyer of certain material licences and permits.
