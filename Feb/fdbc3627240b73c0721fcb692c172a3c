Environmental organisation Greenpeace Africa says ten of its activists appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning and had subsequently been released on bail. The activists were arrested on Sunday and held overnight at Sunnyside police station after running onto the SuperSport Park Stadium cricket pitch, in Centurion, wearing superhero costumes. This happened during the international T20 match between England and South Africa. The activists also dropped a banner from one of the stadium’s floodlights, with the message “Toxic air is not just a game #BowlOutAirPollution” to signal Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy to act against the air pollution crisis in South Africa. The group of activists aimed to highlight the 13 000 premature deaths in 2018 that were caused by air pollution from burning fossil fuels, the environmental organisation stated. "The players on the field and the fans in the stands alike are being poisoned as we speak – simply by being outside. Burning fossil fuels continues to be a strain on our health, our money and ultimately our lives,” Greenpeace said. Last week, Greenpeace Africa delivered packages to the team doctors of South Africa's major sporting teams containing air pollution masks and asked for the doctors to take the threats of air pollution seriously. “Sports enthusiasts know that perfect health is paramount for performance, and the same is true for our sporting heroes. “Fighting for the right to clean air is critical to protect ordinary South Africans' health, the health of our children, and even the health of the teams that we support,” said Greenpeace Africa climate and energy campaigner Nhlanhla Sibisi.
