Education funding and solutions provider Fundi on Thursday launched its new digital student accommodation platform, a single-access source for all things student accommodation. Launching the platform at the Rand Club, in Johannesburg, Fundi CEO Tshepo Ditshego said the organisation chose to pursue a platform for student accommodation owing to the high levels of demand for, and growing deficit in, student accommodation. It also seeks to redefine critical elements of the relationship between students, learning institutions and accommodation suppliers â€“ creating new best practice for this growing sector. The platform connects both students and universities to accommodation suppliers in a safe, secure and transparent way. It features separate portals for students, universities and accommodation providers, thereby providing an ecosystem of partners including students, merchants, institutions and parents in a transparent and secure digital environment. It allows for online viewings of residences. Following the launch, the process of onboarding institutions and their suppliers will now officially begin. This will see the platform populated with accommodation options as the suppliers are registered. Attendees were given the chance to interact with the portal at the event. The offering is posited to grow considerably over time, with positive initial responses already received.
