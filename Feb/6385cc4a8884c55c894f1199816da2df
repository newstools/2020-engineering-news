Automotive component supplier Bosal Afrika on Thursday officially opened its new emissions control systems (ECS) manufacturing plant, in Pretoria. Bosal invested about R25-million to relocate the ECS plant, which was previously joined with its first facility down the road, which is now a dedicated towbar manufacturing facility. The new 18 000 m2 ECS plant produces exhausts, heat exchangers for exhaust systems, silencers and manifolds for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Bosal Afrika has long-standing customer relations with automotive original-equipment manufacturers including Ford, Nissan, Isuzu and Volkswagen, in South Africa. Bosal International chairperson Karel Bos said the new ECS facility set a standard for the global Bosal group, owing to its lean manufacturing layout and operation, which would ensure better efficiencies in the plant. Bosal Afrika MD Danie van Vuuren said that by implementing lean manufacturing processes and supplying additional products, Bosal was poised to double its revenue for hot and cold ECS by year-end in South Africa. Trade and Industry Deputy Minister Fikile Majola commended Bosal for investing further in its South African operations and said he considered Bosal as a key investor in growing Pretoria’s automotive hub.
