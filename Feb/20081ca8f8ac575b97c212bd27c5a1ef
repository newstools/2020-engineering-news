Eskom has announced that load-shedding will not be implemented on Wednesday. "While the system remains vulnerable, several units have returned successfully and good progress has been made in replenishing emergency reserves," said the power utility in a power status update. It warned, however, that power cuts could be implemented at short notice if there are shifts on the system and repeated its request for customers to use electricity sparingly. The utility has previously said there will be an increased likelihood of load-shedding over the next 18 months as it conducts critical maintenance on its ageing fleet of power stations.
