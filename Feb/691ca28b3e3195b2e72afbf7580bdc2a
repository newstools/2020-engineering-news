JSE-listed Tiger Brands has officially opened its new Oat Mill for its first and oldest product – Jungle Oats – in Maitland, Cape Town. Speaking at the opening event on Friday, unit manager Rees de Villiers outlined some of the advanced features of the new mill. “With this state-of-the-art building and technology, the new mill has increased efficiencies and significantly improved output. Notwithstanding this, however, the overall carbon footprint has actually been reduced through the installation of higher-efficiency motors, which reduce the energy input per tonne.” Tiger Brands invested R208-million on the new mill. A significant portion of the funds was allocated to contracting local civil engineering and building construction services, as well as local engineering installations. A total of 120 people were employed in the construction of the new mill. “The infrastructure spend is further proof that we are proudly anchored in South Africa and are committed to the country’s success,” the company says. Other socioeconomic benefits of the new mill include investment in oat farmers. The company has invested in ten black South African farmers, who will plant 100 ha of oats this year, through its Smallholder Farmer Programme. The unveiling of Jungle Oats’ new mill also coincided with a major milestone – the product’s 100th anniversary.
