Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) Adam Habib has announced his resignation from the university at the end of December this year, after seven years at the helm. He will be joining the School of Oriental and African Studies, or SOAS, in London, as director, from January 1, 2021. “My decision was not made lightly – I am a proud leader and champion of Wits University and South Africa, and will continue to fly these flags high. I have committed to strengthening ties between the South African and UK higher education sectors in my new role,” he said. Wits University Council chairperson Isaac Shongwe congratulated Habib on his appointment and called him a dynamic leader, who has made a significant contribution to Wits and the local and international higher education sectors. “His fearless, forthright commentary and his general robustness has left our university, and South Africa, a richer intellectual space, for which we are grateful,” Shongwe said. Habib was instrumental in the country during the FeesMustFall campaign which brought many changes in the higher education sector, including free education for underprivileged students. Shongwe highlighted that Habib implemented the Wits 2022 strategy and under his leadership, Wits has surpassed in its endeavours. Habib highlighted his achievements, noting in 2019 that Wits had graduated over 9 500 students, the most in the university’s history. Shongwe asserted that Wits had an increasingly sought after executive team and assured that the university was confident it would appoint a suitable successor.
