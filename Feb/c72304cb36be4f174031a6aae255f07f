Infrastructure provider Openserve on Tuesday said the repair under way on one of the affected segments of the West African Cable System (WACS), off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was nearing completion. This will allow the repair ship, the Leon Thevenin, to depart for the next repair destination on February 6, two days earlier than originally planned. The vessel will travel on to offshore Ghana next, to attend to the repair of a section of the South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC). Both the WACS and the SAT3/WASC experienced breaks two weeks ago, resulting in slow Internet connectivity in South Africa. Openserve expects all repairs to be completed by about February 25.
