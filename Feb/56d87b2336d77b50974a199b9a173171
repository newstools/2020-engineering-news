US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) CEO Adam Boehler has been selected by US President Donald Trump to serve as executive chairperson of Prosper Africa, a US government-led initiative that aims to substantially increase two-way trade and investment between the US and Africa. He will lead efforts to coordinate and mobilise the tools and resources of 16 US government agencies in support of Prosper Africa's mission. “Prosper Africa is helping harness Africa's tremendous growth trajectory to unlock new opportunities for both American and African businesses. I’m honoured to chair this important initiative and advance both American and African competitiveness through the power of private enterprise,” Boehler comments. Working in close coordination with the White House, Boehler will be supported by an interagency secretariat that will work to maximise the impact of US government tools to mobilise private capital, improve business climate and accelerate African economic growth. Victoria Whitney, formerly senior director for strategy and communications at United States Agency for International Development (USAID), will serve as the COO of the Prosper Africa secretariat.
