Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) has taken the first step in the roll-out of its local electric mobility programme, through the launch of the e-Golf pilot project. The e-Golf pilot project will see six fully electric vehicles (EVs) being tested by motoring and lifestyle media, selected dealers as well as Volkswagen employees, in an effort to gain consumer insights into the varying experiences of driving and living with an EV in South Africa. Through the involvement of selected Volkswagen dealers in Gauteng and Western Cape, the e-Golf pilot project also seeks to drive customer awareness and education regarding EVs. The e-Golfs will be used as shuttles and courtesy cars for Volkswagen customers. “At Volkswagen, we want to democratise electric mobility and that is why the e-Golf pilot project is a key initiative for the brand,” says  VWSA sales and marketing director Mike Glendinning. “With the help of our dealers, we want to get as many South Africans as possible to drive and experience an EV as this is the future of our brand.” The e-Golf pilot project includes rolling out charging infrastructure at Volkswagen’s Uitenhage manufacturing plant, as well as the Dealer Training Academy in Centurion, Gauteng. The project is the first step of a three-phase approach that will pave the way for Volkswagen to include EVs in its future product portfolio in South Africa. The second phase will be expanded to include a fleet of fully electric Volkswagen ID.3 vehicles from 2021. The third and last phase of the electric mobility project will see the first fully electric Volkswagen vehicles available for sale to customers in South Africa from 2022. VWSA notes that the e-Golf as well as the ID.3 will not be available for sale in South Africa and will be used solely for the purposes of ensuring that as many South Africans as possible get to experience life with an EV.
