Eskom says it is not planning to institute rotational power cuts on Thursday as it has seen a "number of improvements in the power system". Its emergency reserves of diesel and water are also at adequate levels. "However, we remind customers that load-shedding can be implemented at short notice if there is a change in the system performance. Eskom will communicate if there is any shift and will provide a prognosis for tomorrow later today. " The utility said that unplanned breakdowns were at 9 462MW at 6 am. Eskom has previously said there will be an increased likelihood of load-shedding over the next 18 months as it conducts critical maintenance on its ageing fleet of power stations
