SA Taxi has announced that AutoZone is the latest automotive supplier to join its rewards programme. This partnership sees the SA Taxi Rewards programme, launched in 2018, expand beyond fuel-based rewards for the first time. The new initiative gives loyalty card holders additional opportunities to earn cash rewards and airtime top-ups by purchasing automotive parts, spares and car accessories from AutoZone branches. AutoZone is a distributor of auto parts, spares and car accessories for the passenger and light commercial vehicle markets in Southern Africa, including Namibia, Swaziland and Botswana. “Providing convenient and widespread access to quality, affordable auto parts for taxis can lower operating costs, improve vehicle efficiency and reliability, and enhance safety, which benefits both operators and commuters,” says SA Taxi communications executive Maroba Maduma. “We are delighted to join the rewards programme and broaden our support for the minibus taxi industry, which is such a vital cog in the local economy,” adds AutoZone merchandise and marketing executive Michael Da Paixao. Maduma notes that expanding SA Taxi Rewards partners beyond the fuel sector is a major development in the evolution of the loyalty programme. “As a vertically integrated business platform that creates a sustainable environment for the minibus taxi industry, and through our partnership with the South African National Taxi Council, we launched this pioneering multi-faceted loyalty programme to provide additional financial support and deliver added value to local minibus taxi operators. “Expanding access to high quality, affordable auto parts and spares is a major component in our ongoing efforts to create a safer and more sustainable industry.” AutoZone joins Shell and Bridgestone as SA Taxi Rewards partner. The loyalty programme is available to all taxi owners.
