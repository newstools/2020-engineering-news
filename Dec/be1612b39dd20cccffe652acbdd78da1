The Solidarity Fund and Return2Work have published a range of free downloadable resources to assist employees and employers in staying safe over the festive period, and ensuring a safe return to work next year. The resources have been loaded onto www.return2work.co.za and include health and safety training materials for employers, unions and other resource organisations that engage with employees, and employee health and safety guidelines beyond the workplace. The resources are not only aimed at educating workers around staying safe in their workplaces and beyond but to assist employers in educating workers in a more collaborative space around health and safety in the current context. Moreover, the resources intend to lay the groundwork for employers and employees to begin exploring how they can build more cohesive workplaces. The Return2Work initiative was launched by government to offer businesses clear and simple step-by-step guidance on reopening and staying open, incorporating the key legal requirements and tools to minimise infection and maximise compliance during the time of Covid-19. Solidarity Fund was launched by government at the start of the lockdown to support the country’s national health response and contribute to humanitarian relief efforts.
