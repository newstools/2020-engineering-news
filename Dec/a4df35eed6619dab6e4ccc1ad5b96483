The Department of Tourism and the Technology Innovation Agency have embarked on the joint implementation of the Tourism Technology Grassroots Innovation Incubation Programme (TTGIIP). The department has extended an invitation for South Africans aged 18 to 35 to apply for the course before January 8. The programme is aimed at stimulating entrepreneurship and new start-up enterprises in the tourism industry, underpinned by technology, innovation and new business ideas that have the potential to enhance services and experiences in tourism. The purpose of TTGIIP is to provide a pipeline of young South African tourism-tech entrepreneurs who can enhance or disrupt the industry, as well as introduce new concepts that will help boost, sustain and create more jobs in the tourism sector. Through its Enterprise Development Framework, the department has advocated for entrenching technology as an integral element in tourism operations by fostering and supporting innovation in the sector through the development of strategic partnerships across the public and private sectors to leverage resources and skills for effective programme implementation.
