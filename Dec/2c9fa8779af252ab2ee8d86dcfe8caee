Nonprofit organisation (NPO) the Construction Management Foundation (CMF) has entered into a strategic collaboration with fellow NPO Balwin Foundation to support the organisation in its continued quest to train emerging and small contractors from communities surrounding developments by JSE-listed Balwin Properties. The training programme will result in more than 200 small contractors being trained through the Small Contractor Training Programme, developed and delivered by the CMF. CMF CE Ronnie Siphika says the training programme will be delivered as an accelerated blended learning programme over five days, with over 15 face-to-face training workshops and group activities. Accomplished industry leaders will also be invited to engage with small contractors on “what it takes to establish and manage a successful construction business”. The programme starts in Johannesburg in December and will extend to Pretoria East, as well as the Cape provinces and KwaZulu-Natal in 2021. This training collaboration with the CMF is an extension of the Entrepreneurship Programme that Balwin ran in 2019, which was attended by more than 100 small and medium-sized enterprises, startups and individuals from local communities in which Balwin operates. Balwin Foundation MD Theresa Vitale, meanwhile, notes that 24 of the first 25 attendees at the first small contractor course are female.
