Airports Company South Africa’s (ACSA’s) efforts to create a safe airport environment for travellers have been recognised by the Airports Council International (ACI) after several of its airports received the Airport Health Accreditation. The airports that received this accreditation are Cape Town International Airport, King Shaka International Airport, Bram Fischer International Airport, Upington International Airport and East London Airport. The ACI’s Airport Health Accreditation programme recognises commitment to the health and welfare of passengers, airport staff and the public by supporting airports in assessing the new health measures and procedures introduced to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation Council Aviation Restart Task Force recommendations, along with industry best practices. The programme is designed to help reassure the travelling public that airport facilities remain safe and that precautions are being taken to reduce any risk to their health. ACSA client services group manager Eugenia Boinamo commented in a statement on December 9 that “regaining public confidence in air travel is important to us and one of the ways of achieving this is giving our passengers the guarantee that it’s safe to travel through our airports”. She added that receiving this international accreditation from ACI illustrates that ACSA has prioritised, and will continue to “prioritise the health and safety of passengers”. Since the opening of air travel in South Africa, ACSA has implemented a number of health and safety protocols in the airport space, and this accreditation by ACI “shows our commitment to making the customer journey a safe and pleasant experience”.
