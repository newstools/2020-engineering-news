Japanese car maker Nissan has announced that it will unite its operations on the continent under one region, namely Africa. Several leadership changes have been made as part of this restructuring, effective December 1. Former Nissan South Africa MD and Africa South chairperson Mike Whitfield has been appointed Africa Regional Business Unit MD. Whitfield has been with Nissan for nearly 40 years. In his new role, Whitfield will report to Joni Paiva, divisional marketing and sales VP for the Africa, Middle East, India and Oceana region, and will be based between Rosslyn, in Pretoria, and Cairo, in Egypt. In another appointment, Kabelo Rabotho has been named Nissan South Africa (SA) country director. He replaces current Nissan SA MD Shinkichi Izumi, who is being reassigned to a position at Nissan in Japan. Rabotho has more than 25 years’ experience in the marketing and sales environment. He joined Nissan in 2016 after serving in management roles at BMW South Africa and Toyota South Africa. In his new role, he will be responsible for all revenue generation functions, as well as being the market lead for Nissan in South Africa. Nissan says the new appointments will enable the business to drive forward its strategy in Africa. “This includes enhancing our focus on the customer with increased authority and autonomy, continuing development of manufacturing capabilities across the continent, streamlining our shared services for operational excellence, and finally, giving employees more room for growth.” Nissan also believes that the new management structure will allow it to capitalise on an accelerating demand for vehicles in Africa, and see its market share grow as the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement is implemented.
