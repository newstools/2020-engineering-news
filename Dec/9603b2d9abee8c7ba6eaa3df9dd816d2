In the coming months, 23 women in the construction industry will undergo business development coaching with Grow South Africa, compliments of the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI). The department has sponsored the Grow Master Class programme for the winners of the inaugural Empowerment and Recognition of Women in Construction (Erwic) Awards 2020, an awards programme developed by the Construction Industry Development Board to celebrate and encourage women in the construction industry and showcase women-led projects and achievements. The coaching and strategy sessions run by Grow will see the award recipient develop in this regard, as Grow helps businesses in South Africa convert business success into economic growth through entrepreneurial leadership. By undertaking the coaching process, recipients will learn to grow their business through strong leadership, enabling them to set direction and achieve operational excellence, supported by a winning team. The launch event included an introductory business coaching session from Grow South Africa coach Sakhile Mkwanazi, who emphasised the value of strategic focus and value-adding activities in both day-to-day operations, as well as long-term efforts.
