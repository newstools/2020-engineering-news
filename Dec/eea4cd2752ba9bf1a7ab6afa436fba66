Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom has appointed Wole Abu CEO for Liquid Telecom Nigeria and its new Africa Data Centre (ADC) in Nigeria, effective January 2021. "Abu [has] over 14 years of experience in the telecommunications industry, which will be integral as we continue to expand our fibre network reach on the African continent. "With our East to West link going live, it is integral that we start working with businesses in Nigeria to develop the local telecom and technology ecosystem and also establish ourselves as the go to data centre provider," says Liquid Middle East and West Africa regional CEO Mohamed Abdel Bassit. Before joining Liquid, Abu was CEO of Pan African Towers, and before that, he served as the VP of sales at Airtel Nigeria. He has also held several senior management roles in the human resources, engineering, operations, finance, legal and marketing departments. Meanwhile, Liquid recently acquired land in Lagos to build the ADC, which the company says will be the single largest data centre in Africa outside of South Africa. The new data centre, once completed, will address the growing demand for cloud storage and digital services on the continent and Abu will be responsible for overseeing the strategic growth of ADC's operations in this new market. "Since the launch of the first Africa Data Centre in 2018, I have seen the data centre team grow their operations by leaps and bounds to cater to the rapidly developing cloud ecosystem on the African continent. "I am excited to bring my polyfocal blend of functional skills to the team as the ADC makes it possible for Nigerians to get access to cloud services at affordable rates and allowing them to meet local data regulatory requirements". "I also look forward to showcasing Liquid's commitment to Nigeria's digital transformation journey, which is linked to staying true to our belief that every individual has the right to be connected," Abu comments.
