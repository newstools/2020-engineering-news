Toyota Financial Services South Africa (TFSSA) has appointed Thabo Manaka as its new CEO, effective January 1. Manaka is succeeding Marius Burger, who is retiring at the end of the year, after seven years at the TFSSA helm. Currently TFSSA director and corporate administration senior VP, Manaka has steadily risen through the ranks after joining the financial services company in 2007. His career spans both the public and private sector. “Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) can rely on Thabo and his continued support at TFSSA,” says TSAM president and CEO Andrew Kirby, who is also TFSSA chairperson. “[He] has demonstrated his range of management skills, along with experience and curiosity that could not be more relevant to transform TFSSA into a mobility-savvy organisation in the years ahead. “It is only with teamwork that the challenging TFSSA goals can be achieved.” “I thank the board and the shareholders for the confidence they have in me to lead Toyota Financial Services,” notes Manaka. “2020 has been challenging so far, with difficulties attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic impacting all people, not only locally, but the entire globe. “At TFSSA, we recognise the importance of adapting to these changing times. As the world evolves, so will the financial and mobility solutions, and we can assure you that we are ready to put the smiles back on our customers’ faces.”
