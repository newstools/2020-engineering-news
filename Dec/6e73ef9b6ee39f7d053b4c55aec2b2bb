Several critical Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) tenders have been advertised to expedite the Vaal river raw sewer spillages intervention work. The tenders, which were advertised on November 27, will close in January 2021. Work is expected to start in March 2021. The DWS is seeking civil engineering and mechanical engineering contractors and consultants to implement the works within 36 months. “Of particular focus, the intervention will entail upgrading the existing 44 pump stations, three wastewater treatment plants and the bulk sewer network,” the DWS said in a statement on December 8. This followed the expiration of 10 contracts from Ekurhuleni Water Care Works, which ceded the work to DWS. A compulsory tender briefing/clarification for all framework contract prospective tenderers took place on December 8. “Two contracts have already been signed with Sakhile Ezweni and Moreki Distributors for security services and labour respectively. These contracts are for six months, from September 2020 to March 2021.” Further, the Sebokeng Waste Water Treatment Works’ Module 6 is currently being commissioned and the commissioning process is due to be completed on December 15, provided there are no interruptions to operations. Discussions on water infrastructure being National Key Points, which took place on 19 November 2020, have concluded that the application will be done by Emfuleni local municipality and the documentation will be sent to the municipality to start the application process.
