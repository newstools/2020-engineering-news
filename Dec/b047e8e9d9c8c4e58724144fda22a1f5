Black-owned and women-led solar company Power4Less, which was launched earlier this year by Juliet Mwakutuya, Dineshree Naidu and Nafeesa Fareed, aims to supply rent-to-own solar solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and larger company. "From our experience South African businesses are embracing solar solutions from SMEs to large corporates,” Fareed says. "To give you an idea, Power4Less has, in the last few months, worked on solar solutions for various projects ranging from a Nandos drive-in, a Shoprite centre in Rustenburg to a shelf manufacturer in Pretoria,” she adds. Power4Less says the rent-to-own solution enables consumers to pay a small monthly fee instead of a large capital outlay and enable a saving of up to 50% on their energy bill over a five-year period. After the five-year period, the consumer will own the solution and have no energy costs. "By giving a solution that will save on energy costs and avoid load-shedding, we believe that this product is a game changer in the solar power sector," Fareed acclaims.
