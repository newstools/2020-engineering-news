The Competition Commission has recommended that the Competition Tribunal approve the proposed transaction whereby Stanlib Fund II intends to acquire Solar Capital De Aar 3 (SCDA 3), without conditions. Stanlib Fund II is involved in the provision of financial services and SCDA 3 is a solar photovoltaic (PV) independent power producer (IPP) in the Northern Cape. Of relevance to this merger assessment, is the fact that the Stanlib Fund II holds interests in various wind and solar PV IPPs operating under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. The commission found that the proposed transaction is unlikely to result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition in any relevant markets. It further found that the proposed transaction does not raise any public interest concerns.
