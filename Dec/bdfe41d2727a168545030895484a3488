The University of the Western Cape (UWC) says its 2 700-bed Unibell student residence is on track to start operating its administration area early in 2022, after construction work got under way in September. Located in Belhar, the R640-million residence is within walking distance of the university’s main campus and a train station. The development entails three pockets of land, with the brick work progressing first on the section that will accommodate the student housing department’s administration area, which will welcome the first intake of students in two years’ time. Unibell will offer a combination of unit-style and hotel-style residences, with a communal area for relaxation, shared kitchen spaces and laundry rooms, as well as a gym, television rooms, WiFi and study facilities. The development has so far employed 1 000 people from the local community for the duration of construction activities.
