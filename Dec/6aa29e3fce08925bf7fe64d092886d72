The South African management team of SNC-Lavalin South Africa, led by VP Stuart Kent, has completed the buyout of the local entity and renamed it Aurex Constructors. The management team of the South African entity recognised the advantages of becoming a wholly owned South African company. In addition to the agility and faster response and turnaround times offered by local management, the buy-out serves the country’s strategy to transform South Africa’s economy through increased ownership and management opportunities for previously disadvantaged South Africans, the team states. As Aurex Constructors transforms into a South African owned and managed business, its strategy is to focus on its core competencies and continue to deliver gold standard construction and turnaround and maintenance projects across all energy sectors. “This is a very exciting time for the business as we navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, recalibrate our strategy, our processes and procedures to align with the local landscape and move forward as Aurex Constructors, while leveraging our legacy and expertise to best serve our customers,” Kent comments. The company believes it is poised for continuous growth. It will aim to continue to deliver projects successfully to its existing customer base, while also looking at opportuniteis to extend its service offering into new markets targeting new customers.
