The Competition Commission has recommended that the Competition Tribunal approve the proposed transaction whereby Engie intends to acquire Xina Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and Xina CSP Operations & Maintenance (O&M), without conditions. In South Africa, the Engie Group supplies a mix of renewable energies. Its energy projects in South Africa include the Aurora Wind Power Project. The Xina Solar One Project, controlled by Xina CSP, is a CSP plant in the Northern Cape. Xina CSP O&M operates and maintains the Xina Solar One plant. The commission found that the proposed transaction is unlikely to result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition in any relevant markets. It further found that the proposed transaction does not raise any public interest concerns.
