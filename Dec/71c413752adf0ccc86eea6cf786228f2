Fibre and fixed wireless broadband provider Herotel has reached the milestone of 100 000 fixed broadband subscribers on its fibre and fixed wireless networks. The group, which was started in 2014, deployed its own fibre networks, targeting non-metropolitan, underserviced areas across South Africa and introduced uncapped, unshaped and unthrottled broadband at a low price, while integrating about 39 owner-operated businesses it acquired over the past four years. “By hitting the magical 100 000 customer mark on our own network, we can officially say that Herotel is the third-biggest player in the South African fixed broadband market, deploying networks beyond the traditional fixed line footprint,” said Herotel CEO Van Zyl Botha. Herotel successfully added 55 000 organic new customers to its network by “offering better pricing and direct service to clients” and retained the 45 000 customers that came with the businesses that joined Herotel. The company, which aims to pass another 445 000 premises on its network – which is about 10 000 stands for each of its 45 offices – has raised the R910-million in funding it requires to build the infrastructure. “This fibre expansion with its network of 2 500 towers will allow it to connect many more South Africans to the Internet with two-thirds of its customers on fibre and one-third on fixed wireless,” he said. “We currently have 105 towns and projects in build phase with many more in planning,” Botha continued. Meanwhile, as part of the milestone celebrations and in line with its vision of “Everyone Connected”, Herotel has partnered with nonprofit organisation Digital Village to provide one free Internet connection to those who cannot afford the minimum monthly subscription, for every paying Herotel subscriber on its network.
