Independent regional airline Airlink will launch a new non-stop service between Cape Town and Harare from January 18. This is the latest in a series of new and resumed routes across the airline's Southern African network. “Airlink is excited to be launching this important new route, which will provide convenience to  business and leisure travellers, saving them precious hours transferring via Johannesburg and also limiting their exposure to potential touchpoints, which is a key consideration as we adjust our travelling habits during the Covid-19 pandemic. "Airlink’s unique service on the route will also support trade, commerce and tourism between the two cities and their respective markets at a time when it is desperately needed,” says Airlink CEO Rodger Foster.
