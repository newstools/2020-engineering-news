The Department of Transport has partnered with South African alcoholic beverages manufacturer Distell on a 365-day Arrive Alive road safety campaign. Distell has also committed to supporting the road safety interventions of the department through increased public awareness and to intensify the mass communication of its campaign to encourage responsible drinking behaviour. The 365-day Arrive Alive agenda is an action plan that seeks to re-imagine road safety in South Africa and to transform road user behaviour. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says the agenda is anchored on the National Road Safety Strategy 2016 to 2030 and is firmly grounded on its strategic pillars. “The lawlessness that characterises driver behaviour on our roads is a source for concern. While our interventions are primarily focused on enforcing the law, such enforcement will remain futile until we succeed in inculcating responsible behaviour by motorists and other road user,” he states. Mbalula adds that the department  has developed a five-point plan that seeks to reduce road fatalities by at least 20% this year. “However, it must not be forgotten that the attitude and behaviour of our drivers remains the biggest problem on the roads. In the last year, human factors contributed 85% towards fatal crashes compared with 91% in the previous year. Mbalula adds that the alcohol industry has a responsibility and a role to play, in collaboration with the department, to robustly educate communities on the dangers of drinking and driving, besides others. He notes that eradicating drunk driving is one part of a bigger picture that requires a broad coalition, characterised by partnerships with corporate citizens like Distell.
