Piotr Czyzyk has been appointed as the new MD for Goodyear South Africa (SA). In his former role as product business unit commercial director in Europe, Czyzyk was responsible for overseeing Goodyear’s Central European operation. “I have had the good fortune of forging a career, gaining a wealth of experience and growing an international stakeholder network at a company which is one of the world’s leading tyre manufacturers,” says Czyzyk. “My skills and passion have been harnessed for nearly 20 years, in a place where, quite literally, the rubber hits the road.” “As a gateway into the rest of the continent, South Africa is a key market for Goodyear, not only in terms of strengthening our geographic footprint and regional ties, but also in proving our ability to innovate local solutions which draws on our global insights,” he adds. “This new economy is a challenge for every business, so new ideas and perhaps, unconventional thinking is what is needed for companies such as ours to thrive under new conditions.” Czyzyk notes that Goodyear has built its reputation in the market by remaining a customer-centric business and “remaining relentless” in its pursuit of cutting-edge innovation. He believes he has the right team to lead the business into the new year. Goodyear SA made two additional strategic appointments in addition to its new MD. With a tenure at the company that spans a little over a decade, Wayne Nicholson was appointed commercial product business unit director. Yugan Moodley joined Goodyear SA in November as consumer product business unit director.
