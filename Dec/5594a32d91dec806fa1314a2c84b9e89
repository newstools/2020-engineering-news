Water utility Rand Water on December 15 met with Emfuleni executive mayor Gift Moerane about a debt settlement agreement. The municipality owes Rand Water about R1.1-billion in outstanding debt, with Rand Water having reduced the water pressure to the municipality by 20% as a credit control action to compel the municipality to meet its obligations to settle amounts due to Rand Water for water services rendered. The municipality on December 11 signed a debt settlement agreement with Rand Water, in which the municipality outlines its intention to settle the amounts due to the water utility. The meeting was held to further discuss the agreement, with Rand Water having agreed to assist the Municipality with managing its current bulk water distribution. In the meantime, Rand Water plans to continue with the water pressure reduction. Rand Water has also developed a Water Use Efficiency Strategy and is advocating for its adoption by the municipality, stating that its urgent implementation will save the municipality large volumes of water and money.
