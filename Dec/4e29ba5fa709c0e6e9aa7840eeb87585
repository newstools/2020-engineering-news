The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has appointed six nonexecutive directors to the interim board of South African Airways (SAA). Geoff Qhena will be the board’s interim chairperson, and will be joined by Peter Tshisevhe, June Crawford, Bembe Zwane, Professor Edna van Harte and Nick Fadugba. The interim board will, together, be expected to restore proper governance and oversight of the airline during the implementation of a business rescue plan. The DPE says the combination of academic, financial, legal and aviation experience, with a deep knowledge of global aviation and transport trends, “will bring a new perspective as the national carrier prepares to relaunch next year”. The appointments also enhance the independence and balance of the board, while continuing the process of transformation and renewal. In charting the way forward, the DPE believes the key to solving the difficulties facing SAA is the finalisation and implementation of the business rescue process, followed by the start of a restructured airline; appointment of a leadership team; and securing a credible strategic equity partner who can introduce the required technical, financial and operational expertise into the business. “The new airline will be run in a professional and sustainable manner to support key economic sectors – including tourism, trade with the continent, the local aeronautics industries and local service providers,” the department says.
