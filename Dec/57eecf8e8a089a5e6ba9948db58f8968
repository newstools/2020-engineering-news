SA Taxi Auto Parts (SATAP) this year again participated in the Black Friday movement as it hosted a variety of consumers, such as taxi operators, taxi drivers, school transportation operators and tour travel operators, at a parts sale at its facility in Midrand. SATAP offers refurbished taxi parts that are washed, inspected, tested where possible, and labelled so that they are ready for sale. These include, but are not limited to, engines, panel parts, lamps, and electrical components. The Black Friday deals were an effort to alleviate financial pressure on taxi operators as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. SATAP believes the Black Friday sale should aid in ensuring that minibus taxis are fitted with “reliable parts for safer multiple short-distance trips and long-distance trips,  ensuring the safety of commuters during this festive season”. “SA Taxi is proud to host such initiatives as a way to give back into the industry and put money back into the taxi operator’s pocket,” says SA Taxi communications executive Maroba Maduma. SATAP on Black Friday made 5.9% less sales compared with the previous year, which it says speaks to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the taxi industry.
