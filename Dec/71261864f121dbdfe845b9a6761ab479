From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: The first phase of the new multibillion-rand Castle Gate mixed-use precinct development in Pretoria has officially opened its doors to the public. Home to some of the latest store concepts for the likes of Woolworths, Checkers, Dis-Chem and Builders Warehouse, Creamer Media Journalist Simone Liedtke gives us a quick tour.  Simone Liedtke: Engineering News was invited to visit the site a day before its official opening on November 26. Built with the intention of “making something that creates convenience and makes life easier”, Atterbury development manager Raoul de Villiers tells us a bit about the new Castle Gate centre.

The centre is eco-friendly and has a solar farm with the capacity to generate around 1 MW of power.  Atterbury Development Manager Raoul de Villiers:  Simone Liedtke:  Visitors can also expect future developments at the centre.
