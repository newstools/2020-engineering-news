The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) will launch the Export Barriers Monitoring Mechanism (EBMM) on August 31. The EBMM will be a single channel for companies to report and receive assistance in resolving export barriers, the department said in a statement on August 28. Trade, Industry and Competition Deputy Minister Fikile Majola says the EBMM will be open to all companies that require assistance in overcoming export challenges. The EBMM will also be able to assist with barriers encountered locally and in foreign markets, and companies reporting to the EBMM will receive dedicated government support, with a comprehensive resolution strategy developed for each individual barrier. “While the EBMM is open to receive barriers encountered in all markets, it will have a particular focus on smoothing trade with the rest of Africa,” Majola says, noting that the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), in particular, offers unprecedented opportunities on the continent, and “building a conducive environment for the movement of goods in the region is key to unlocking the potential of the agreement”. He adds that the EBMM will be part of a comprehensive programme of work to address the nontariff barriers that stifle regional trade. The launch event next week will include an overview of the EBMM and how to make use of the system, details of special support for firms looking to trade with Africa, as well as a panel discussion on export barriers featuring top business leaders.
