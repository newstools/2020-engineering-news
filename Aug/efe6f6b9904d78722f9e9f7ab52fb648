Property developer Balwin reports that its newly created entity, Mooikloof Mega Residential City: Gauteng (Mooikloof Mega City), has been designated by the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission Council as a strategic integrated project (SIP) in terms of Government Gazette No. 43547 published on July 24. Balwin states that the SIP designation means that the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure will pay for all external bulk services installations such as water, sewer, electricity, roads and stormwater for the Mooikloof Mega City. The Mooikloof Mega City entity is intended for the purposes of entering into a corporate joint venture with Seafront Lux owned majority by Johan Franck and Paul Hailwood. Along with the SIP designation, Balwin has been in negotiations with Franck and Hailwood regarding the possibility of a joint venture to undertake the Mooikloof Mega City project, as the two individuals have extensive sectional title development experience. Both have also been in negotiations with the departments of Human Settlements and Public Works and Infrastructure, as well as other governmental departments, to have the development recognised as an SIP for the past ten years. Balwin will be a 70% shareholder and Seafront Lux will be a 30% shareholder of Mooikloof Mega City and their relationship will be governed in terms of a shareholdersâ€™ agreement To take advantage of the fact that all bulk services and bulk contributions will be covered by government, Mooikloof Mega City has concluded two sale agreements for the purposes of starting the Mooikloof Mega City development.
