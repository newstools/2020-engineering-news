JSE-listed Italtile has appointed Brandon Wood CFO with effect from August 3. He succeeds Tsundzukani Mhlanga, who resigned with effect from June 30. Italtile said Wood’s appointment follows an extensive recruitment process conducted by the group’s nominations committee. He is considered to be well qualified for the position, having previously served as Italtile’s CFO from 2013 to 2018, whereafter he held the positions of executive director: commercial and supply chain and subsequently executive director: retail. In light of the board’s stated goal to streamline the group’s overhead cost structure, accelerated by the current Covid-19 era, the position of executive director: retail will fall away.
