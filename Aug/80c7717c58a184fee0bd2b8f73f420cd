The South African Council for the Architectural Profession (Sacap) has published this year’s new Guideline Professional Fees in the Government Gazette. This follows after the council had consulted with voluntary associations and formulated recommendations related to principles referred to in the Council for the Built Environment Act. The council determines fees that registered persons are entitled to charge in terms of the professions listed in the Act. The guideline fees are required to promote market efficiency and redress consumers and the public information deficit, relative the professional’s knowledge and expertise. The fees are not prescribed or set as a maximum or minimum mandatory fee to be charged for professional serves rendered, but serve as a guideline. The fees take into consideration a reasonable rate of return on investment, intellectual capital, effort and risk. “In addition [to consultation with voluntary associations], research was undertaken on the salaries of various registered persons across all categories of registration. This was to ensure that the guideline professional fees are cost related. “The Guideline Professional Fees have since been published to provide guidance and to ensure that the fees charged by registered professionals providing architectural services and are thus negotiable between professionals and their clients,” Sacap registrar Advocate Toto Fiduli states. The new Guideline Professional Fees are attached.
