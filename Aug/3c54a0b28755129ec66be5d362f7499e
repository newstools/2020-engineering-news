The South African Payroll Association (Sapa) is conducting a survey to obtain insights into South Africa’s payroll deductions landscape. The survey results will assist in accelerating the process of finalising an informed, robust and comprehensive regulatory position on payroll deductions in South Africa. The survey will be undertaken on behalf of the National Treasury, the South African Reserve Bank, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, the National Credit Regulator and the departments of Public Service and Administration; Trade, Industry and Competition; and Employment and Labour. This follows the publication of a paper in March 2018 titled ‘Joint Consultation Paper: Regulatory proposals on payroll deductions’ and subsequent consultation process. The regulatory proposals explored in the consultation paper seek to achieve a safe and efficient payroll deduction system that works in the interests of employees.
