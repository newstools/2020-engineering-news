They will further reinforce strict adherence to corporate governance in all its manifestations. The organisation’s performance will be monitored and overseen by various mechanisms, including committees of the board and an independently-chaired ethics committee. There would also be regular Umgeni Water stakeholder engagements that assess compliance to contractual obligations and quarterly reporting to the executive authority. “As the process for the appointment of a permanent board is rolled out, Umgeni Water will continue to perform at optimum in governance and associated matters.”
