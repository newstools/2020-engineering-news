Nissan South Africa has launched what it calls “intuitive digital application technology” to assist customers when applying for vehicle finance online. The Nissan pre-finance tool is powered by WesBank and allows customers to check affordability by completing a pre-approval form before applying for finance. Nissan South Africa says it is the first vehicle manufacturer in South Africa to offer pre-financial approval on their website, which is linked to the credit bureau. “The intelligence or algorithms built into the tool provides immediate confirmation of approval or declined status, while allowing the customer the flexibility to structure their deal using balloon payments or deposits. “The process is seamless, convenient and quick, and removes the hassle of the full vehicle application process, which is usually tedious and time consuming. Once the customer receives an approval, a reference number is issue with the full downloadable deal structure for the customer to use at their dealer once they are ready to purchase.” “As the first OEM to partner with WesBank, we are excited for this collaboration to respond to our customer’s needs using digital innovative solutions,” says Nissan South Africa head of customer experience and digital, Nancy Moodley. “The integration of WesBank’s digital application technology into our website will enhance Nissan and Nissan Finance’s offering to prospective Nissan vehicle owners.” “When developing this platform, our goal was to make the online journey of applying for vehicle finance a stress-free conversation, not an interrogation,” adds WesBank head of digital, Dane Reddy. “We ask the applicants to tell us a bit about themselves and the car they are interested in purchasing and in under ten minutes we can tell them whether they are approved for the requested vehicle financing or not. If not, we can offer them alternative options to fit their budget.”
