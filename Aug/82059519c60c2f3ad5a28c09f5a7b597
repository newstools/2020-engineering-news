Financially-beleaguered State-owned defence industrial group Denel has confirmed that it has received the judgment against it by the Labour Court, handed down on Tuesday. The case had been instituted by two of the unions representing workers at Denel. The court ordered the group to pay its workers their outstanding salaries and other statutory obligations. In its statement, Denel said it was studying the judgment. It also assured that it was “committed” to fulfilling all its obligations to its employees. “Once again, Denel apologies for the stress and anxiety caused to all employees as a result of the current uncertainties,” said the group in its statement. “The shareholder [the government], the Board and management are relentlessly working to ensure that the business overcomes its short term challenges and returns to a sustainable situation, actively contributing towards keeping South Africa safe by securing its sovereign and strategic defence and other technological capabilities.”
