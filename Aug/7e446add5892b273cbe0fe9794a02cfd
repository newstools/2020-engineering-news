An online business-to-business virtual marketplace for the South African and African General Aviation (GA) sector will be launched later this month. This is an initiative of Messe Frankfurt South Africa, organiser of Africa’s largest GA trade show, AERO South Africa. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the physical AERO South Africa show had to be postponed to July next year. “After engaging with numerous role players, endorsing partners and businesses within the General Aviation sector, we are extremely excited that we have sufficient support to launch this initiative that will place General Aviation brands at the forefront of a targeted market,” enthuses AERO South Africa show director Annelie Reynolds. “This way buyers and sellers can continue to meet, engage and do business from a centralised portal, without leaving their homes.” The online platform will allow AERO South Africa to continue to support the GA sector even though it has not been able to hold its actual show this year. Exhibitors will be able to display their products and services on the platform to a worldwide audience, and thereby maintain their presence in the market. The platform will remain active for 12 months. Its search function has a personalised category option, allowing the immediate identification of products and enterprises that are aligned with the searcher’s business. It also has an intelligent matchmaking capability to match the searcher’s company with the appropriate customers. “Registration is free to all trade visitors,” assured AERO South Africa. “The added bonus is that you won’t need a visa or passport to visit the marketplace from abroad.” AERO South Africa is presented in cooperation with Messe Friedrichshafen, which organises the AERO Friedrichshafen show. This is the world’s largest GA show, attracting 35 000 people from 60 countries. AERO South Africa 2019 attracted 4 200 visitors with 120 exhibiting companies from 37 countries and covering 14 aviation sectors.
