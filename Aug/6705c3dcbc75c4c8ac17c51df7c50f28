JSE-listed packaging and paper company Sappi has completed a sustainability performance measurement for its dissolving pulp brand, Verve. Sappi supports the sustainability drive by the textile value chain through its Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) membership and through the use of the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) tool. The company's Cloquet mill, in Minnesota, in the US, completed the Higg FEM self-assessment for Verve. The self-assessment results have exceeded internal expectations and position the operation as a leader in sustainable practices, evidenced by a low environmental footprint, says Sappi. Unfortunately, current Covid-19 restrictions have prevented an on-site verification process from taking place; however, members of the SAC are invited to connect through the Higg portal to view the results and engage with Sappi further in this regard. The Higg FEM is part of the Higg Index suite of tools that was developed by the SAC to allow the apparel industry to measure their sustainability performance. Sappi joined the SAC in February 2019 and remains a committed member of the organisation, being a participant in many of the SAC events and engaging in ongoing discussions on how to enhance the tools on offer.
