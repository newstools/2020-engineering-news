To enhance bilateral trade and investment ties, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) will, in collaboration with trade promotion agency Wesgro, host a virtual wine mission to South Korea. The event, to be held on August 27, will showcase ten wineries from the Western Cape region. Each winery will present their wines to an audience of 20 South Korean wine importers and distributors, who will have an opportunity to taste these wines, as samples have been shipped to them ahead of the mission.

Trade, Industry and Competition Deputy Minister Nomalungelo Gina says the Covid-19 pandemic has not only negatively impacted on the healthcare sector, but also the South African economy in its entirety. “A sector that has been particularly impacted by Covid-19 has been the wine industry, owing to the ban placed on alcohol sales by government and the accompanying travel protocols. "Wesgro identified this to be a critical sector requiring support and had embarked on the concept of a virtual mission that would enable the promotion of small to large size wineries to new markets,” she notes.
