The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries has confirmed that environmental assessment practitioners (EAPs) have until February 7, 2022, to register with the Environmental Assessment Practitioners Association of South Africa (Eapasa). This extension of 24 months, from the prior deadline of February 8 this year, has been gazetted, allowing for additional time for the facilitation of additional applications and for the processing of applications received by the registration authority. The National Environmental Management Act states that no person other than a registered EAP may hold primary responsibility for the planning, management, coordination or review of environmental-impact assessments and associated environmental management programmes. The department has encouraged all non-registered EAPs to submit their applications for registration with Eapasa before the next deadline.
