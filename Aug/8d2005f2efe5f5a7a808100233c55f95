Sasol, the fuel and chemicals maker, will shut its $13-billion Lake Charles Chemicals Project due to Hurricane Laura making landfall on the US Gulf Coast. “Given Hurricane Laura’s forecast path,” Sasol will temporarily close down its facilities at Lake Charles, Louisiana, as well as Greens Bayou and Winnie, Texas, a spokesperson for the company said. The Houston Wickchester office will also close. Any damage or delays from the storm would put pressure on Sasol, which has already experienced mismanagement and cost overruns at the US expansion project. “We will continue to monitor the situation and resume operations when it is safe to do so,” Sasol said.
