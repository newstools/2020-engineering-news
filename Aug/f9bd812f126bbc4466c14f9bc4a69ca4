Paper and pulp manufacturer Sappi Southern Africa has announced two new senior appointments in the form of Duane Roothman as Sappi Forests VP and Mark Barnardo as Roothman’s successor as Sappi Forests GM. Roothman takes over the position from Dr Terry Stanger, who retires on August 31 after 27 years of service with the company. Roothman has been with Sappi for 25 years and has held various roles within Sappi Forests, most recently as Sappi Forests GM, in KwaZulu-Natal. In his new role, Roothman and his team will focus on increasing Sappi Southern Africa’s timber self-sufficiency, leveraging the company’s significant scientific and technical forestry expertise commercially and accelerating timber supply efficiency improvements. Meanwhile, Barnardo has been appointed as Roothman’s successor as GM for Sappi’s forestry division in KwaZulu-Natal, with effect from September 1. He is currently the senior area manager for Sappi Forestry South in the province. Barnardo joined Sappi Forests in 2011. He has served in various positions in both Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, as well as worked for various other multinationals where he gained extensive forestry knowledge and experience over the last 20 years.
