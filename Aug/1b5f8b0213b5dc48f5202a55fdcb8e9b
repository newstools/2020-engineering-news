Poultry producer Astral Foods reports that its chairperson Dr Theuns Eloff and CEO Chris Schutte have both recovered from Covid-19. The company announced on July 16 that Eloff and Schutte had contracted the disease, following which Eloff self-isolated and received medical treatment. Schutte had undergone cardiovascular surgery in August 2019 and was therefore regarded as a “high risk” patient. He was under strict supervision of his team of physicians and also self-isolated at home. As of August 5, both Eloff and Schutte have fully recovered and have resumed their duties.
