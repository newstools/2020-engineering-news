Communications solutions provider Liquid Telecom South Africa has rebranded to Liquid Intelligent Technologies in a strategic repositioning to advance South Africa’s digital future. In 2018, the group embarked on a journey to adapt its operating model as it started the transition towards becoming Africa’s leading digital services provider. “The acquisition of the Samrand data centre and the ability to quickly adapt as Covid-19 required innovation in work-from-home capabilities, have shown that Liquid Telecom is in the position to reshape the South African technology industry and to fully realise its market position as a digital service provider of choice for businesses locally,” the company said in a statement. As Liquid transitioned the business over the past two years, it has added new products and solutions in addition to the connectivity offering, as well as continued providing the open-access network that has resulted in the availability of fifth-generation technology across South Africa. To ensure operational efficiency and improved service delivery to customers, Liquid Telecom has developed a new operating model to address its technological and structural needs for growth. “As such, the company needs to develop people and improve organisational maturity that will enable us to operate in our intelligent technology business to generate immediate and sustainable value to our current and future shareholders and exceed our customer expectations to be more competitive in our industry.” “Our structures, skills and capabilities need to be rapidly developed and augmented to effectively exceed the expectations of our customers,” the group concluded.
