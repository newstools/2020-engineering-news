Member organisation Business for South Africa (B4SA) has noted the announcement by the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) that Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) benefits are to resume following the halting of payments owing to investigations into system integrity problems. “The move is greeted with relief, though it is still unclear why it was necessary to bring the entire system to a standstill for several days,” says B4SA Labour Workstream chair Robert Legh. Notwithstanding the announcement, B4SA says it is not aware that any payments have actually yet been made. The organisation reiterates that, as has been the case over the months that the UIF has experienced a series of serious administrative issues, its member companies are willing to make available expertise on a pro bono basis to assist with remedying these.
