In line with Scania’s global purpose to drive the shift towards a sustainable transport system for business and society at large, Scania South Africa has partnered with the Limpopo Economic Development Agency (LEDA) and the Thulamela municipality to develop the R15-million Scania Thohoyandou workshop. As part of the ethos of ‘Driving the Shift’, identifying new opportunities and finding solutions to local challenges is an important part of the company’s mandate, says Scania Southern Africa MD Fabio Souza. The new Scania workshop investment supports the revitalisation of the under-used industrial park owned by the LEDA in Thohoyandou. With spatial challenges isolating rural businesses, the new location of the Scania-endorsed Thohoyandou workshop will ensure that the black-owned business partner, Scania Boarder Auto Centre, is now closer to its market, while customers will have to travel shorter distances to have their vehicles serviced. Scania Southern Africa marketing and communications GM Nomonde Kweyi says the workshop’s improved proximity will allow for improved service efficiencies for valued customers. At the soil turning event last week, Souza outlined Scania’s commitment to making a sustainable contribution within the communities it operates in. In conjunction with Scania’s donation of the building of a mathematics classroom and science lab and handover of computer equipment at Ramauba Secondary School in Tshikwarani village Masia, the new workshop will create over 20 job opportunities for local residents. As part of the partnership, Scania will service the buses that transport workers and school children in the greater Vhembe district. The workshop will also offer an approved apprenticeship programme, giving many aspiring workshop technicians the chance to train locally. The workshop is slated to be built by April 30, 2021.
