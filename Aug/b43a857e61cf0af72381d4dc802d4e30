Development finance institution, the African Development Bank, has announced the 24-month debarment of Sangtech International Services, Sangar & Associates (Nigeria), Mashad Integrated and Investment Co and Medniza Global Merchants. All four companies are registered in Nigeria. An investigation conducted by the bankâ€™s Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption established that the debarred companies allegedly engaged in fraudulent and collusive practices during a tender for the supply of water meters, automatic meters and house connection materials under the Zaria water supply expansion and sanitation project in Nigeria. The sanction renders the four companies ineligible to participate in AfDB-financed projects during the debarment period. Additionally, the 24-month debarment qualifies for cross-debarment by other multilateral development banks, including the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank Group, under the Agreement for Mutual Recognition of Debarment Decisions. The Zaria water supply expansion and sanitation project in Nigeria is co-financed by the African Development Fund, an entity of the AfDB.
