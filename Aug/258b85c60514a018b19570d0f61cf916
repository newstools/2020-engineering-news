The Presidency on August 26 confirmed that all Covid-19-related government expenditure has been published online. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer has published a full list of all companies who have been awarded contracts by government for the supply of goods and services relating to the pandemic. The information, which is available on the National Treasury's website, includes Covid-19 procurement information from all provinces, national departments and more than 70 public entities. The move is in line with a directive issued by President Cyril Ramaphosa on August 5 for departments to submit full information on Covid-19 tenders to a Ministerial team convened by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola. “This measure is unprecedented and a clear demonstration of government’s commitment to transparency and accountability when it comes to allegations of corruption in the Covid-19 procurement process,” Ramaphosa said in a statement. He added that the collaboration and cooperation between government departments during this process had been laudable and was a clear indication that the State was going to intensify its efforts to act against any individuals or companies involved in corruption and profiteering around the pandemic. The Treasury will regularly update the online register to ensure information remains current. “By publishing these lists, we have honoured our promise to the South African people. They enable proper scrutiny of the details of all companies that have received tenders for Covid-19-related services,” Ramaphosa stated.
