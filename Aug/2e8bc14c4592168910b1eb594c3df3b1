The organisers of the Manufacturing Indaba have decided to host the event virtually this year. The event, to be held on December 9 and 10, will be free and will allow companies and clients to interact safely with each other. After consultation with industry partners and taking into account the latest government guidelines, as well as regional travel restrictions, the organisers decided it best to host the conference virtually this year. Topics for this yearâ€™s conference will include how to future proof a manufacturing business, what the African Continental Free Trade Agreement means for African manufacturers, sustainable and profitable manufacturing in the era of Covid-19, and the importance of localisation to build local markets for self-sustainability and creating an alternate source of supply from the Eastern markets. All the provincial Manufacturing Indaba events and the East Africa edition have been postponed to the second half of 2021.
