Telecommunications giant Vodacom has appointed Raisibe Morathi as its new Group CFO, effective November 1. Morathi, who is joining Vodacom from Nedbank Group, where she was the Group CFO since 2009, is the successor to Till Streichert, who left the position in June. Sitho Mdlalose, who has been interim CFO since July 1, will move to his new role as Vodacom South Africa CFO, reporting to Morathi and Vodacom South Africa designate CEO Balesh Sharma. Morathi, a chartered accountant, has acquired 26 years of experience, including 20 years in executive roles at institutions such as Industrial Development Corporation, Sanlam and Nedbank. She completed an advanced management programme with INSEAD (France), as well as a higher diploma in taxation from the University of the Witwatersrand, and will complete her Masters in Philosophy (Corporate Strategy) at Gordon Institute of Business Science within a few months. “Raisibe has a proven track record in dealing competently with complex leadership challenges and driving strategic transformational change,” said Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub. “Given Vodacom Group’s leadership position as a mobile money provider in Africa and our accelerated growth ambitions beyond traditional Telco services, Raisibe’s extensive financial services experience makes her an excellent addition to the Vodacom Group board and executive committee,” he concluded.
