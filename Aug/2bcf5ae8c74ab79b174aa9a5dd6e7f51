Forty-one medical interns who studied abroad have passed their exams and are being sent to various provinces in South Africa. This adds to the 2 369 interns who have joined the Department of Health (DoH) from the beginning of this year. The DoH on Friday said all hands were needed on deck and that this was the biggest medical intern allocation programme in history. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said the human resources of the DoH were the first pillar of the Presidential Health Compact. “It is a premier position among the nine pillars, highlighting the significance government places on strengthening and sustaining human resources for the health care sector,” he commented. The Minister pointed out that the country would also soon welcome more than 650 graduates from the Nelson Mandela Fidel Castro Cuba medical programme. These graduates will begin their reintegration programmes in preparation for their qualifications to practice in South Africa. “This phenomenal recruitment drive forms part of implementing the programmes that emanate from the resolutions of the Presidential Health Compact. “Without doctors, there is no healthcare system. I am extremely proud of the department’s achievement to ensure that the South African medical fraternity continues to grow,” said Mkhize.
