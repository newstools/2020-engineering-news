An extension to September 4 has been granted for public comment on the geographical areas identified as Renewable Energy Development Zones (REDZ) for wind and solar, as well as for the related environmental authorisation processes. In a series of government notices published in July, Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy had called for public input as part of the public consultation process on the amendment of procedures to be followed in applying for, or deciding on, environmental authorisation applications for large-scale wind and solar photovoltaic activities. These also related to the identification of geographical areas of strategic importance for the development of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, large-scale wind and solar photovoltaic energy facilities and strategic gas transmission pipeline infrastructure. The areas of strategic importance for energy development were determined through three strategic environmental assessments undertaken between 2016 and 2019. Public input was also requested on the identification of procedures to be followed when applying for, and deciding on, environmental authorisation applications for REDZ activities. Moreover, a generic environmental management programme relevant to an application for environmental authorisation for the development or expansion of gas transmission pipeline infrastructure, and a standard for the development of electricity transmission or distribution infrastructure within identified geographical areas, were gazetted.
