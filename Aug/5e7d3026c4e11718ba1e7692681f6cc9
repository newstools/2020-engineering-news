The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) is preparing for a strike at the National Health Laboratories Service (NHLS) to amicably resolve a salary dispute dating back to August last year. The decision follows an “unsuccessful meeting” convened yesterday with the management of the NHLS and the union. Nehawu has obtained a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration non-resolution certificate that paves a way for a strike action. The union says management has failed to implement a proper Performance Management and Development System and as things stands, its members and workers are still waiting for their long overdue payments. In a statement, Nehawu said the strike action will be used as a launching pad for the broader national programme of action that the union is currently implementing to defend and protect its members and workers in general against coronavirus (Covid-19). “As Nehawu, we find it unacceptable that the NHLS management has elected to defend unfair labour practices by discriminating our members and workers who successfully appealed for their salary levels to be upgraded, despite an impartial expert committee recommending that these workers must be progressed,” said the union. The union is also unhappy about the NHLS management’s 0% salary increase for the 2020/21 annual salary negotiations. It has also expressed dissatisfaction that a large number of its members and workers at NHLS have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with over 700 workers already infected. “This is a clear indication that the lives and employment conditions of our members at NHLS are not taken seriously, and we are left with no other choice but to take a stance in defence of our members and workers. The union has already started with strike balloting processes and will be taking the war to the intransigent NHLS management and the Department of Health should these issues in dispute not be resolved,” the union said.
