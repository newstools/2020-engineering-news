Terminal operator Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) recently awarded a contract to global technology company TATA Consultancy Services (TCS) to develop a logistics platform that will enable the company and the broader industry to integrate into the logistics supply chain. “Cargo Connect is an online platform in the form of an application that can be considered a logistics marketplace. Customers will have the ability to submit logistics-related requests on the platform and allow service providers to bid and the preferred proposal will be selected,” says TPT sales and new business GM Siyabulela Mhlaluka. As a key node in the supply chain handling import and export cargo, TPT will, through the Cargo Connect application, maximise digital solutions to increase transparency and provide rapid tracking of cargo at every point of the container journey. According to Mhlaluka, there is a need for a South African online platform that integrates comprehensive logistics information and facilitates the rapid identification of optimal providers for required logistics services. Moreover, cargo owners and logistics players will also rapidly receive critical information about their containers as soon as the cargo event occurs.
