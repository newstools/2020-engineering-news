The drill rig at emerging natural gas and helium producer Renergen’s Virginia gas project production hub, in the Free State, is preparing to spud the first well in the programme. The upcoming programme of inclined wells target the gas productive fracture systems at the project. After several weeks of careful planning and interaction with the company’s geological and engineering consultants, Renergen believes it has planned a hole “which will maximise [the project’s] chances of gas intersection along the interpreted fracture systems”. Results are still about a month away, CEO Stefano Marani says.
