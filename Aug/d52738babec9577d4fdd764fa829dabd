Independent power producer Globeleq has appointed Jonathan Hoffman chief development officer (CDO). The newly created CDO role is intended to unify the company’s growth strategy. Hoffman, who will be based in Cape Town, has led business development activities in Southern Africa as an MD since 2015. He originated and managed Globeleq’s growth into target countries such as South Africa and Mozambique. Starting with Globeleq in 2010, Hoffman was “instrumental” in securing South Africa’s first wind and solar ventures and building a robust pipeline of projects across the region. In recent years, he helped to secure the Temane gas-fired power and the Cuamba solar storage projects in Mozambique. He continues to support the regional team to bring these deals to financial close. Hoffman previously worked for ABB Energy Ventures on landmark projects, Bear Stearns in mergers and acquisitions and co-founded InfraCo pioneering infrastructure projects in South-East Asia.
