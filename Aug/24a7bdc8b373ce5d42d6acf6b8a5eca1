Energetic materials manufacturer Maxam has officially launched its new integrated blasting service, called X-Energy, which is aimed at addressing and optimising the total cost of ownership in mining, quarrying and infrastructure operations through a continuous improvement spiral. X-Energy integrates selective energy applications in a fully digitalised mine cycle and combines some of the most advanced explosives technology in the market (like Smart Rioflex) and a set of digital tools for optimised blast design and execution, integrated in Maxam Blast Center – a cloud-based platform enabling the full digitalisation of the blasting services. Maxam’s Smart Rioflex technology can quickly adjust the explosive density to match a range of rock mass conditions, with one single matrix and sensitizing unit, the company explained in a statement on August 3, noting that its mechanical sensitisation provides more control than chemical gassing, ensuring the exact product quantity at the right stemming length and saving operational time. Additionally, owing to its tailormade, modular nature, X-Energy allows the end-user to develop a customised solution for each operation, and also allows the selective application of the explosive energy according to the rock properties, resulting in clear sustainable savings to its customers, explains Maxam chief technology officer Vicente Huélamo. The X-Energy application allows a mine to customise the design and execution of each individual blast and integrate it to the requirements of downstream operations. The benefits include enhanced safety, a reduced impact to the environment, optimised rock fragmentation, the efficient use of energy, higher production and reduced costs, which can help mines become more competitive and sustainable.
