The construction industry is among the most male-dominated industries in the world, but in South Africa, women seem to be well represented in the industry. According to the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB), 48% of South Africa’s construction companies are owned by women. This shows the effort invested in this sector to ensure that women are equally benefiting from the opportunities this sector offers, the CIDB posits. Nevertheless, female representation can still be improved, the organisation says. “As a nation, we need to create developmental funding solutions that will cater for the female entrepreneurs who have endeavoured into a challenging and previously male-dominated sector such as construction sector. "Perhaps a wholly owned women development organisation in construction could be the starting point for greatness,” comments women-owned construction company National Construction Incubator finance committee chairperson Babalwa Mapisa.
