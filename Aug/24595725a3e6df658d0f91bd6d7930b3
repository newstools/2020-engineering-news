The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has welcomed State-owned power utility Eskom’s steps to recoup funds lost to State capture corruption. Eskom and the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) announced on August 3 that a set of summonses had been issued in the North Gauteng High Court to recover funds from former Eskom executives, board members and members of the Gupta family and their associates. The DPE said that, as the shareholder representative, it supported the claim for damages of about R3.8-billion, and future investigations by the SIU in terms of a Presidential proclamation of 2018. The department added that this “is an essential milestone in the fight against corruption and State Capture and ensuring that those that were found to be complicit and benefited from the malfeasance that resulted are held accountable”. The DPE confirmed that it would work closely with Eskom and other State-owned companies in following up all other instances of corruption that have been covered at the Zondo Commission and through media investigative reports. “We are confident that the legal action will give impetus to the broader fight against massive corruption, which must not only see funds recouped, but also ultimately lead to the arrests and criminal prosecution of suspects,” the DPE said in its statement. It further urged law enforcement agencies to expedite the criminal cases opened against the natural and juristic persons identified to be complicit in this action to “ensure that they face the full might of the law”.
