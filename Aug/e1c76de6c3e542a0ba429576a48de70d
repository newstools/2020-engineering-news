The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF) has invited public comment on the Technical Guidelines for Validation and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by September 24. The purpose of the verification guideline is to support the implementation of the mandatory greenhouse-gas (GHG) reporting regime in South Africa. South Africa is currently implementing a voluntary mitigation system focusing on the country’s GHG emission reduction commitments. These are contained in South Africa’s Nationally Determined Contributions deposited with the United Nations in 2015. South Africa has committed to mitigating the effects of climate change through the reduction in emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In terms of the verification guidelines for reporting GHGs, under the National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Regulations (NGERs), certain processes need to be followed to verify the emissions data and submissions made by data providers. DEFF explains that the guideline provides further detail required for implementation of Section 11 of the regulations. This section outlines the legal requirements for verification of information submitted by data providers to the department. The proposed guideline provides direction to the DEFF, data providers and independent verifiers on the verification process for the NGER, and details the responsibilities of these role players. It applies to all anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks. The guideline also outlines the structure of the NGERs verification programme, the independent verification process to be followed, accreditation requirements of independent verification bodies, and important considerations for all role-players during the verification process. The verification guideline is intended for use in conjunction with the NGERs and the methodological guidelines for reporting of GHGs.
